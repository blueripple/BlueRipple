We should pause for a moment to note how remarkable it is that a model using only a few demographic variables
and votes for a different office has any predictive power at all, much less what we see here.  It’s a reminder
of how strongly demography determines voting patterns and how consistently people vote for one party on the entire
ballot.  That being said, this is nothing like an accurate prediction. And that is unsurprising.  Not only is our data
limited, but state-legislative elections are often strongly influenced by specific concerns, like candidate-quality
and incumbency, for which we have not accounted for at all.

But this will serve our purpose, namely to sort races into “safe”, “needs defending”, “flippable” and “long-shot” and
to limit our donation recommendations to the middle two categories.

## What’s Next?
The CES hasn’t yet validated it’s voting data for 2020.  We’re hopeful that they will complete that soon and then
we can run this model with an eye to the 2021 elections for the VA statehouse.  If we have to, we can use the 2018 voting
data but we’d prefer a more recent sample of voter preference.

We’re applying this model only to VA since those elections are happening soon.  But next year, as we look
to state legislative elections in, e.g.,  GA, TX, PA, OH, and WI, we’ll do the same work there,
and use that to help guide our recommendations in those races.

It’s crucial to start winning back state-houses and Dems can only do that if they support candidates in winnable races.
But that’s not enough.  In some districts, we need to field better candidates–or any candidate at all!  We need to
nurture and fund local organizers and learn what they need to help win state legislative races. This is part
of a larger need to understand and support the role of local organizing in driving turnout and winning elections.

We’ll be writing more soon about specific actions to take on all these issues: candidates we recommend in VA,
and voter turnout organizations to start funding now in various states. Watch this space!
