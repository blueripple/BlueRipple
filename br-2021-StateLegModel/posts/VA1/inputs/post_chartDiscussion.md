We want to pause for a moment to pat ourselves on the back:
our model actually works pretty well! It’s particularly
remarkable that a model using only a few demographic variables
and votes for a different office (U.S. House) has any predictive power at all,
much less the 74% explanatory power that we see here.
It’s a reminder
of how strongly demographics determine voting patterns and how consistently people
vote for one party on the entire
ballot. Although our model isn’t perfect – after all, our data are limited,
and factors related to the specific candidates or incumbency aren’t included at all–we think it
will serve our purpose. With it, we think we will be able to sort
Virginia’s upcoming state legislature races into “safe”, “needs defending”, “flippable” and “long-shot” and
to limit our donation recommendations to the middle two categories.

## What’s Next?
In the coming days, we’re going to apply this model Virginia’s 2021 races,
which are happening this November[^CES2020].
But next year, as we look
to state legislative elections in, e.g.,  GA, TX, PA, OH, and WI, we’ll do the same work there,
and use that to help guide our recommendations in those races.

It’s crucial to start winning back state-houses and Dems can only do that if they support candidates in winnable races.
But that’s not enough.  In some districts, we need to field better candidates–or any candidate at all!  We need to
nurture and fund local organizers and learn what they need to help win state legislative races. This is part
of a larger need to understand and support the role of local organizing in driving turnout and winning elections.

We’ll be writing more soon about specific candidates we recommend in Virginia,
and voter turnout organizations to start funding now in various states. Watch this space!

[^CES2020]: The CES hasn’t yet validated it’s voting data for 2020.  We’re hopeful that they will complete that soon and then
we can run this model with an eye to the 2021 elections for the VA state-house.  If we have to, we can use the 2018 voting
data but we’d prefer a more recent sample of voter preference.
