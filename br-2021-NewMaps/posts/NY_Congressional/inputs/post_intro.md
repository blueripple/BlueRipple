# New Maps: NY “Special-Master” Edition

**Updates 5/21/2022:** This post has been updated to reflect the final map from the NY state court.

NY has had a [long, strange trip][nyStory] to its current
proposed congressional
district map. In 2014, the New York state legislature passed
an anti-gerrymandering law. In 2022, under Dem control, they
created new maps based on the new census and,
depending on who you ask,
skirted the edges of that law or ignored it entirely. A court
agreed that the maps ran afoul of the law and handed map-drawing
responsibilities to a “special master,” a court
appointed district-map-drawing expert.

Last Monday, a draft map was released by the special master,
and a slightly [different map][NYMap] was finalized by the court late
Friday night.
Unsurprisingly, this map
is less favorable to Dems than their hand-tuned one. There is a
[*lot*][mapviews]
of disagreement, though, over how to look at this map (NB: these arguments
are about the first map released by the special master, not the court’s final
map). Quite a bit of that
is about frame of reference.  The map is defintely worse for Ds than
what the legislature tried to do, but seems better for Dems than the
current map (the one used from 2012 through the last election in 2020),
though also more competitive than either.
And it’s that last bit that leaves room for interpretation.
In a neutral or good year for Dems, this map is better than what they had before.
But in a wave year for Rs, this map could be worse. And, of course, any state
or district can defy the national trend.

We haven’t had much time with the map but here’s a quick look!

## 1. Dem-lean by district in NY: our demographic model vs. historical data

Our “demographic” model forecasts the potential Democratic lean of each
new district in NY based on attributes like race, education, and
population density. In the graph and table below,
we compare our predictions to a “historical” model (from the excellent
[Dave’s Redistricting (DR) web-site][DavesR]) built up from precinct-level
results in prior elections[^voteShare]. (See methods at the end of this post for more details.)
The axes show the projected 2-party Dem vote share with each model.
The diagonal line represents where districts would fall on this scatter-plot
if the two models agreed precisely. In districts to the left of the line,
our demographic model thinks the D vote share is higher than historical results,
and to the right of the line, we think it’s lower than the historical model predicts[^old].

We’re not attempting to predict outcomes, or compete with the historical model as an
early estimate. Instead, our model looks only at demographic makeup and population
density of the district to infer a 2-party share. Large differences between
the historical model and our demographic one *may* point to pickup opportunities or
vulnerabilties.

[^old]: We’ve also done this modeling for the old districts and compared that
result to the actual 2020 election results. See [here][oldDistricts].

[^voteShare]: One important note about the numbers. Dave’s Redistricting gives
estimates of Democratic candidate votes, Republican candidate votes and votes
for other candidates.  We’ve taken those numbers and computed 2-party vote share
for the Democratic candidate, that is, D Votes/(D Votes + R Votes). That makes it
comparable with the Demographic model which also produces 2-party vote share.
