We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model and 47-53% in the historical model.
That’s because we think a 3-point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking. Our demographic model carries some
additional uncertainties, so we expand the range a bit there.  Our methodology for
using our model and the historical data to classify districts is explained
[in this post][BRMethodology].

With that in mind,  here are a few observations on the new NY districts:

- First, let’s dispense with the obvious ones. Several NY districts are clearly
  far outside the competitive range. Both the demographic model and the historical
  model agree that 15 districts (NY-4, NY-5, NY-6, NY-7, NY-8, NY-9, NY-10, NY-12, NY-13, NY-14,
  NY-15, NY-16, NY-17, NY-25, and NY-26) are safe D.
  Both models also agree that 3 districts (NY-21, NY-23, and NY-24) are far out of reach for Dems.

- We are much more optimistic about NY-2, NY-3 and NY-11 than the
  historical model.  We think they are all safe D.  But the historical model sees
  them as tossups, with NY-2 and NY-3 as D-leaning and NY-11 as R-leaning.
  historically safe D.

- Our model sees a strong D-lean in NY-1 where the historical model sees safe R.

- We are concerned about vulnerability in NY-19 which we see as a safe R district
  where the historical model sees
  a D-leaning toss-up. Similarly, in NY-20, our model sees a
  D-leaning toss-up where the historical model sees a Safe D district.

- The remaining districts (NY-18 and NY-22)  are tossups in both models.

We see this as an 18D-4R-4C (“C” for “competitive”)
map.  The historical analysis, based on the last 3 elections, sees something more like
16D-4R-6C.

The table below shows this in a different form:
