Below we chart the 2020 *election results* and compare them to the model. This is so we have some sense
that the model makes sense and some sense of how approximate we might expect it to be.

The election result is on the x-axis and our model estimate on the y-axis,
and a line representing where districts would fall on this scatter-plot if the model
and election result agreed precisely.  Weâ€™ve also included confidence intervals from the model.
In districts left of the line, the model overrestimated the D vote share and
underestimated it in districts to the right.
