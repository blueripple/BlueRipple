The model seems to capture the trends pretty well, though it has some significant misses, particularly
in the safe R districts, where the model overestimates the likely D share[^misses] (ignore
NC-12 here: the Dem ran unopposed and so the election result does not reflect true D share in that district.)
We’re most interested in districts between 45% and 55%, scant though they are in this map.
In that range the model does pretty well.

[^misses]:We’re not convinced that we are handling population density as well as we could.  Even on
a log scale, the variation is large and very different state-to-state.  We’ve worked on this some
without any simple solution.
If we make significant progress there, we’ll update this note.
