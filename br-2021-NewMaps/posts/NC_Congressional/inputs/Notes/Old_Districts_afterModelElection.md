The model seems to capture the trends pretty well, though it has some significant misses, particularly
in the safe R districts, where the model overestimates the likely D share[^misses] (ignore
NC-12 here: the Dem ran unopposed and so the election result does not reflect true D share in that district.)
We’re most interested in districts between 45% and 55%, scant though they are in this map.
In that range the model does pretty well.

[^misses]:We’re not convinced that we are handling population density as well as we could.  Even on
a log scale, the variation is large and very different state-to-state.  We’ve worked on this some
without any simple solution.
If we make significant progress there, we’ll update this note.

Let’s turn to the new districts. We got the new map from an excellent web-site called
[“Dave’s Redistricting”][Daves] (DRA). We’ll talk more about their analysis below.
First let’s look at the demographic/density breakdown of these new districts using
the same type of chart as above.
