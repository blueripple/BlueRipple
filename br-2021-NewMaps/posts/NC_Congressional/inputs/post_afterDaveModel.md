We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model and 47-53% in the historical model.
That’s because we think a 3-point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking. Our demographic model carries some
additional uncertainties, so we expand the range a bit there.  Our methodology for
using our model and the historical data to classify districts is explained
[in this post][BRMethodology].

With that in mind,  here are a few observations on the new NC districts:

- First, let’s dispense with the obvious ones. Several NC districts are clearly
far outside the competitive range and don’t merit serious investment by Dems
looking to maximize their impact. Both the demographic model and the historical
model agree that NC-2, NC-4, NC-12, and NC-14 are safe D.
Both models also agree that NC-3, NC-5, NC-7, NC-8, NC-10 and NC-11 are far out of reach for Dems.
- We think the rest are competitive: NC-6 is likely-D, NC-1 we see as a toss-up but the
historical model says safe-D, both models agree that NC-13 is a toss-up and NC-9
an R-leaning toss-up.
- In sum, we think there are 4 safe D (NC-2, NC-4, NC-12, NC-14), 1 almost safe-D (NC-6),
3 toss-ups (NC-1, NC-9, and NC-13) and 6 safe-R (NC-3, NC-5, NC-7, NC-8, NC-10, NC-11[^collegeTown])

Here’s a different look at the data, in a table sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.

[^collegeTown]: In NC-11, our model prediction is substantially below the historical prediction.
We’ve seen this pattern in a few other districts which roughly fit the description “college town,”
in this case, Asheville, NC.  One hypothesis is that in ignoring the *age* of voters, our model
misses a significant factor which is especially significant in places with an unusual concentration
of young likely voters. For techincal reasons having to do with the way the census distributes
tract-level data, it is challenging to get age, education and race/ethnicity
information at the same time, and we’ve chosen to keep education and race/ethnicity.
There are some ways to extract a probabilistic estimate of age distribution in a tract and
implementing something of that sort os on our 2024 road map.
