We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model and 47-53% in the historical model.
That’s because we think a 3-point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking. Our demographic model carries some
additional uncertainties, so we expand the range a bit there.

With that in mind,  here are a few observations on the new NC districts:

- First, let’s dispense with the obvious ones. Several NC districts are clearly
far outside the competitive range and don’t merit serious investment by Dems
looking to maximize their impact. Both the demographic model and the historical
model agree that NC-2, NC-4, NC-12, and NC-14 are safe D.
Both models also agree that NC-3, NC-5, NC-7, NC-8, NC-10 and NC-11 are far out of reach for Dems.
- We think the rest are competitive: NC-6 is likely-D, NC-1 we see as a toss-up but the
historical model says safe-D, both models agree that NC-13 is a D-leaning toss-up and NC-9
an R-leaning toss-up.
- In sum, we think there are 4 safe D (NC-2, NC-4, NC-12, NC-14), 1 almost safe-D (NC-6),
3 toss-ups (NC-1, NC-9, and NC-13) and 6 safe-R (NC-3, NC-5, NC-7, NC-8, NC-10, NC-11)

Here’s a different look at the data, in a table sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
