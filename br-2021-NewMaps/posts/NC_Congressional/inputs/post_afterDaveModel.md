We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 47-53% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking.

With that in mind,  here are a few observations on the new NC districts:

- First, let’s dispense with the obvious ones. Several NC districts are clearly
far outside the 3-point range and don’t merit serious investment by Dems
looking to maximize their impact. Both the demographic model and the historical
model agree that NC-5, NC-6, and NC-9 are safe D.
Both models also agree that NC-3 and NC-14 are far out of reach for Dems.
(We actually think NC-14 is worse for Team Blue than what one might think from historical data.)
- The historical model says that NC-2 is a D+3 district. We’re actually a bit
worried about it, because the demographic model pegs it as around R+2.
Conversely, historical data suggest NC-4 leans Republican (R+3),
but we actually think this is winnable for Dems (D+2).
- Folks who rely on historical models would say that the other seven NC districts
look out of reach for Dems (R+3 or more). But of those,
we think NC-10 and NC-12 are solidly in-reach for Dems based
on our demographic model.
- In sum, we think there are 3 safe D (NC-5, NC-6, NC-9), 1 D under threat (NC-2),
1 flippable to D (NC-4), 2 longshots to flip to D (NC-12 and NC-10) and 7 safe R
(in ascending order of safeness: NC-8, NC-1, NC-13, NC-7, NC-11, NC-3,NC-14)
Here’s a different look at the data, in a table sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
