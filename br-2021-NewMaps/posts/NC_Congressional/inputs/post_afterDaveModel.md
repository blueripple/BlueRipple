A few observations:

- Dale, your original question was about the new NC-1. DRA has that district as safe R (R+9), whereas the model has that at lean R (R+4).
- DRA sees the new map as 3 safe D (NC-5, NC-6 and NC-9), 1 lean D (NC-2), 2 lean R (NC-4 and NC-14) and the remaining 8 as safe R.
- Our model sees the new map as 3 safe D, 1 lean D (NC-4, not NC-2), *8* lean R (NC-12, NC-10, NC-2, NC-8, NC-1, NC-13, NC-7, NC-11) and two safe R (NC-14 and NC-3).


Thatâ€™s perhaps best seen in a table (sorted by DRA Dem vote share):
