These districts are all majority white, though NC-12 is right on the line. But there are large variations
in the proportion of voters-of-color and population density among the districts.

Below we chart the election results on the x-axis, our model estimation on the y-axis
and a line representing where districts would fall on this scatter-plot if the model
and election result agreed precisely.  In districts left of the line, the model underestimated the D vote share and
overestimated it in districts to the right.
