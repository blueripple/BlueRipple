As we said above, we’d trust the DRA result over ours if we had to predict an election outcome.
If we were looking at places where we might try to have an impact, we’d be ignoring
the safe D districts and focusing on NC-2 and NC-4. But then we’d try to understand what’s happening
in NC-14, where DRA sees a competitive lean R district and the model says safe R, as well as
NC-12 and NC-10 where the model sees lean R districts and DRA says safe R, though
we imagine NC-12 is the more interesting play since DRA is very unlikely to that wrong.

More succinctly:


As with many gerrymandered maps, this one makes the minority party very safe in their small number
of districts and the majority somewhat less safe in theirs. The DRA analysis has most of the R districts
about R+6 to R+10 but the model sees those, with the exception of NC-14, as R+6 to tied.  Which
means that in a wave election favoring Dems, admittedly not the likely scenario in 2022, this map
might be surprisingly risky for the Republicans.

If the map changes (there is ongoing litigation) or we update the model enough to significantly shift our
view on any of this, we’ll update this note (and let you know).
