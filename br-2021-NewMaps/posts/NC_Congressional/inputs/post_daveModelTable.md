## 2. Districts worthy of Dem donor support
Based on the results above, we think there are four good options
for Dem donors in NC: NC-2, NC-4, NC-10, and NC-12:

- We agree with the pundits that NC-2 is a toss-up that warrants Dem donor support on defense.
- We think NC-4 is closer than it appears to the pundits who rely on historical data.
It’s a good Dem donor investment as a possible pick-up opportunity.
- Even though pundits rank NC-10 and NC-12 as “safe R,” we think they are
solid donation options for Dems who want to go on offense and invest in the
party’s long-term success. We’re not sure these will flip in 2022,
but based on the underlying demographics we think they’re not as far out of
reach as pundits are claiming. Even if supporting Dems in these districts
doesn’t flip them in 2022, we think it could lay the groundwork for success in the near future.

Our findings in NC-10 and NC-12 deserve particular discussion. These look to be "safe R"
given the voting patterns in the precincts within them,
but our demographic model suggests it should be much more Dem-leaning, and maybe even Dem-winnable.
What might this mean? One way to answer this question is to consider the difference between the two models.
Our demographic model asks: if the voting-age citizens of this district turned out and voted like similar people
in other parts of the country,  what would we expect the outcome of this election to be?
Whereas the historical model asks how we'd expect the election to turn out if the voters in this district turn out and
vote as they have in previous elections. This points to a few possible reasons why a historically
deep-red district like NC-10 might look flippable in our model -- including, but not limited to, the following:

- Our model may be wrong about how we define "similar" voters. We've incorporated factors like education and race,
but maybe we've missed key things that make voters in NC-10 different from superficially "similar" voters in other districts nationwide.

- Location-specific factors may depress Dem voting. It's possible that barriers related to voter
access in NC-10 depress Dem vote share below what it would be in other districts.

- Dems may, in fact, have underperformed relative to their potential.
It's possible that more effective candidate recruitment, campaigning, or organizing could, in fact, yield a win for Dems in NC-10.

We don't know which (if any) of these explanations is correct. But our model suggests that if you want to
support Team Blue in NC, and are open to the idea of supporting some long-shot candidates,
then donating to a Dem in NC-10 might fit the bill.

A similar argument, but in reverse, pertains to NC-14.  For some reason, there is a large
discrepancy between the historical voting patterns of the people in NC-14 and what their
demographic profile suggests. We’d be skeptical of donating here but some understanding of
the history of recent elections might be clarifying.

Finally, a few overarching observations.
As with many gerrymandered maps, this one makes the minority party very
safe in their small number of districts and the majority somewhat less safe in theirs.
Although the historical analysis has most of the R districts about
R+6 to R+10 our demographic model sees most of them (except NC-14) as much closer,
between R+6 and tied. That means that in a wave election favoring Dems–admittedly
not likely in 2022, but you never know!–this map might be surprisingly risky for Republicans.
And for Dem donors, it points to several giving opportunities that could help move
the needle in 2022 or future elections.

If the map changes (there is ongoing litigation) or we update the model enough
to significantly shift our view on any of this, we’ll update this note (and let you know).

## 3.	Coming next from Blue Ripple

Here’s where we’re planning to take these analyses over the next few months:

- We’re going to do the same type analysis in many (all?) of the states,
in order to identify the best options for Dem donors in 2022 on both
offense and defense nationwide.
- We’re going to continue to refine and improve our demographic model–we’ll
update this post and others as we do so. Feel free to contact us if you want
more details on the mechanics, or if you’d like to propose changes or improvements.
- As maps get solidified, we’ll set up ActBlue donation links for candidates
(after the primaries) to make it easy for you to donate.

We’re also on Twitter, Facebook, and Github.

## 4. Coda #1: Demographics of new vs. old NC districts
One thing we haven’t seen discussed very much is how redistricting in NC
has changed the demographics in each district. As a way of putting the
demographic model results in context, let’s look at the underlying
population two different ways:

- The first chart below shows each of NC’s proposed 2022 districts,
with the population broken down by race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, Asian,
white-non-Hispanic and other) and education (College Grad and non-College Grad).
Each bar also has a dot representing the (logarithmic) population density[^popDens]
of the district.
The scale for that dot is on the right-side axis of the chart.
For reference, a log density of 5 represents about 150 people per square mile and a
log density of 8 represents about 3000 people per square mile.
We’ve ordered the districts by D-share based on our demographic model,
which is helpful for understanding how the model responds to demographics and density.

- In the second chart, we look at these demographics a different way,
placing each NC district according to its proportion of college graduates
and non-white citizens of voting age. We also indicate (logarithmic)
population density via the size of the circle and modeled D-edge (D-share minus 50%)
via color. This makes it easier to see that the model predicts larger D vote-share
as the district becomes more educated, more non-white and more dense.

[^popDens]: We use logarithms here because
density varies tremendously over districts, from tens to hundreds of thousands of people per square mile.
We use population-weighting because the resulting average more closely expresses
the density of where people actually live.  For example, consider a district made up of a high-density
city where 90% of the population live and then large but low-density exurbs where the other 10% live.
Most people in that district live at high density and we want our density to reflect that even though
the unweighted average density (people/district size) might be smaller.
