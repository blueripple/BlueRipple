In the wake of the SCOTUS decision in
[Dobbs vs. Jackson Womenâ€™s Health Organization][dobbs] and the [defeat of
an anti-choice constitutional amendment in Kansas][kansas], there has been
[much][roevember1]
[speculation][roevember2]
about the political/electoral effects of the changed legal
landscape for abortion, especially given the nationwide
evidence of a
[surge in voter registration by women][surge].

This made us curious about something. Clearly any swing in preference or
turnout will help Ds in a tossup district. But how big a swing would Ds need
to create tossups from some likely R or safe R districts?

So we took a quick look. Below is a table of districts which are likely R (R+3)
or worse and then calculated the shift in preference of existing female voters
*or* turnout of female voters required to shift them to R+1, true tossup range.
We also included the shifts considering only college-graduate female
voters since they skew more pro-choice and
are more likely to vote in the first place. We include only the closest 20.
