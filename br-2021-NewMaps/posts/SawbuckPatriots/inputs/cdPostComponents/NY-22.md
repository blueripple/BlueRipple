NY-22 looks like a flippable toss-up in both Blue Ripple’s demographic
model (50% D) and historical models (53% D). That said, the district’s
makeup poses a risk for Dems, given that its density, education level
of white voters, and racial diversity all skew toward the GOP to varying
degrees (orange circles below). An encouraging sign is that NY-22’s
demographics are similar to those of IL-17 (green circles), which most
pundits rate as blue-leaning toss-ups.
