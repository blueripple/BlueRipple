Historical results and the Blue Ripple model agree that NJ-11 should
run 55-57% Democratic, but there are some signs it could go either way.
On the positive side, the district’s high level of college education
among White eligible voters and relatively high density make it
demographically similar to CT-4, which is historically 62% Dem-leaning.
But there’s also a risk it could swing toward its other demographic
cousins GA-6 and TX-24, which are only 38-40% D based on historical
voting patterns (although our model says they’re more balanced).
