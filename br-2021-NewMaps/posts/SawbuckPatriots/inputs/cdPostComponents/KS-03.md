Blue Ripple’s demographic model puts KS-03 at 53% D,

Its low racial diversity seems to be balanced by the high
education level of white voters (orange circles below).
The potential for Dems here is highlighted by the
district’s demographic cousin, CO-07 (green circles),
which most pundits rate likely D.
