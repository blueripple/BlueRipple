By Blue Ripple’s demographic model and historical models,
CA-27 looks like a clear opportunity for a Dem pick-up (58% D
and 55% D, respectively), despite pundits’ reservations.
Although its college grad fraction among white voters is only
middle-of-the-road, its high racial diversity and density give
it a strong-D flavor (orange circles below). Another reason
for optimism is that it looks fairly similar demographically
to AZ-07 and CA-08 (green circles), both of which are generally
regarded as safe D.
