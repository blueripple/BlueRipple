By Blue Ripple’s demographic model and historical analysis,
MT-01 looks like a tough lift (42% D and 48% D respectively).
It’s extremely low-density and mostly White (orange circles below).
But the high fraction of college-grad women, who we think are
strongly motivated to vote D in this election, can make the difference.
These demographics are pretty unique in a district this close so there
are no spot-on comparisons. But NY-18, a lean D, is also a district
which scores substantially higher for college-grad % than diversity or density.
