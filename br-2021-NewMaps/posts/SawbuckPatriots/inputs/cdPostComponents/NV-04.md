Many pundits rate NV-04 as “lean Dem,”
and our model suggests it might be even tighter than advertised for
Team Blue (52% D), perhaps partly due to its low college grad
fraction among White voters (see yellow circles in the figure below).
But the good news for Dems from our model is that some of
NV-04’s demographic cousins are much bluer–like
CA-06 (green circles), which we and others rate safe D.
