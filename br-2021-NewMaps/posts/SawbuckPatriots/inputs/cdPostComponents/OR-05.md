OR-05 looks like a Dem-leaning toss-up in both Blue Rippleâ€™s demographic
model (54% D) and historical models (53% D). Despite being mostly white,
its mid-range density and education level among white voters
(orange circles below) move it more toward the middle politically.
The upside case for Dems is illustrated by OR-04, which looks perhaps
even more GOP-friendly demographically (green circles) but is
generally regarded as winnable by Team Blue.
