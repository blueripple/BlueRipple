AZ-01 looks like a toss-up in both Blue Ripple’s demographic
model (50% D) and historical models (48% D). Its reasonably
high density and very high level of education among white
voters pull it toward Team Blue, but its low racial diversity
provides a strong counterweight (orange circles below).
That said, the fact that its demographic cousin IL-06 is seen
as a strong-D district suggests that Dems’ chances in AZ-01
may be better than they appear.
