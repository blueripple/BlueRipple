By Blue Ripple’s analysis, pundits are under-calling the
risk to Dems in NJ-03. Historical voting patterns
put it at 55% D, in line with its likely/safe D rating
by many analysts, but our demographic model says it’s much
closer (51% D). That’s not entirely surprising based on
its makeup: NJ-03 is middle-of-the-road between D-
and R-voting districts in terms of both voters of
color and density (yellow circles in the figure).
Without Dem support, the risk is that this district
could go the way of FL-05 and GA-11, which are
demographically similar to NJ-03 (green circles below) but
predicted by historical models and most analysts
to be strongly GOP-leaning.
