Although historical results suggest NM-3 would tilt 57% Dem in 2022,
the Blue Ripple model suggests it’s more of a toss-up at 47% D.
The district’s high fraction of non-White eligible voters is somewhat
counterbalanced by the low fraction of White voters with college degrees
and its extremely low density.
In all of these regards, it’s demographically highly similar to nearby NM-2,
which we and others rate a toss-up.
