The Blue Ripple model sees OH-09 as fairly balanced (49% D),
in line with historically-based estimates (50% D)â€“which is
somewhat surprising given that its low density, racial diversity,
and level of education among white voters (orange circles below)
all point toward more of a Republican lean.
But one reason for optimism is that a demographically related
district, MI-08 (green circles), is rated lean/likely D by some
pundits, suggesting that Dems could win OH-09 as well.
