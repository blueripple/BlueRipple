Blue Ripple’s demographic model is much more optimistic about NE-02
than historical models (58% D vs. 48% D) or most pundits.
Despite the district’s low racial diversity, we think its reasonably
high density and level of education among white voters move it
into striking range for Team Blue (orange circles below).
The “upside” case for NE-02 is represented by IL-11, which
is more diverse but otherwise demographically similar
(green circles) and strongly D-rated by most analysts.
