According to Blue Ripple’s demographic model, Dems’ chances in NV-03
are much better than many pundits are forecasting.
Despite the district’s relatively low percentage of college grads
among white voters, its high density and racial diversity (orange
circles below) push it into 58% D territory. Looking at demographically
similar districts like CA-06 (green circles), which analysts rate safe D,
also suggests Dems have a good chance to win NV-03 if we put in the effort.
