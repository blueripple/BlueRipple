CA-09 shows up as 55-57% Dem in both historical
analyses and the Blue Ripple model, in line with its
lean/likely D rating by most pundits.
However, its low college grad fraction among White voters
is an outlier among D-leaning districts and a possible
source of vulnerability (see yellow circles in the figure below).
There aren’t great comparators from a demographic standpoint
to let us know how vulnerable CA-09 is for Dems,
but it’s a hopeful sign that the district’s nearest cousin,
AZ-07 (green circles),
is a safe D district, suggesting that donors could help
push CA-09 more strongly into blue territory.
