PA-07 looks like a legit toss-up in both Blue Ripple’s demographic model (50% D)
and historical models (51% D). At first glance, its demographics don’t look very
promising, because it’s only a medium-density district with educational and
racial breakdowns strongly in the GOP’s camp (orange circles below).
But on a hopeful note, a demographically similar district, WA-02,
is rated safe D by most pundits (green circles), so we remain optimistic about PA-07 too.
