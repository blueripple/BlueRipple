MI-07 looks like a legit toss-up, with historical models being
slightly more bullish for Dems (51% D) than Blue Ripple’s
demographic one (47% D). The demographic factors aren’t encouraging:
the district clearly aligns right-ward in terms of density,
racial diversity, and white voters’ educational level
(orange circles below). That said, it looks similar on
these measures to CT-02 (green circles), which most pundits
see as more strongly Dem-leaning.
