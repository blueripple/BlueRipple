IL-17 looks slightly D-leaning in historical models (54% D),
but Blue Rippleâ€™s demographic model is somewhat more worried
for Dems (49% D). The mid-density district is mainly comprised
of white voters with lower levels of education
(orange circles below), and all of these factors drag its tendency
toward the GOP. That said, nearby MI-08 has similar demographic
characteristics but is more strongly D-leaning according to
pundits, suggesting the Dems may have a better-than-advertised
chance here.
