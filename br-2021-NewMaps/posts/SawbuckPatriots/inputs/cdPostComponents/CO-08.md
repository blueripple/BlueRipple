Although historical models (51% D) see CO-08 as a toss-up,
Blue Rippleâ€™s demographic model says this district is much
more D-leaning than appreciated. Its education level among
white voters is lower than one would typically expect for
blue districts, but its racial diversity and density push
it strongly toward Dems (orange circles below). We think
it could end up like OR-06, which has even less D-friendly
demographics but pundits think is fairly strongly D-leaning.
