NY-19 looks tight to pundits and in historical models (51% D), but
Blue Ripple’s demographic model sees it as an uphill fight for Team
Blue (43% D). The reasons for our concern lie in NY-19’s low density,
education among white voters, and racial diversity, all of which make
it look strongly R-leaning (orange circles below). Plus, pundits rate
its close demographic cousin, IN-04 (green circles), as a strong-R
district. Bottom line: we’re not sure how, but Dems are making a
serious play for NY-19 despite significant headwinds, and can use
all the help we can provide to win the seat.
