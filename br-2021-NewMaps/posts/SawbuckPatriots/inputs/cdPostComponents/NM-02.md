Both Blue Rippleâ€™s demographic model (51% D) and historical models (54% D)
see NM-02 as a toss-up. Its low density and middling education level among
white voters favor the GOP, whereas its extremely high racial diversity
tilts toward Team Blue (orange circles below). Indeed, the divergent
potential outcomes in NM-02 can be seen by comparing it to two of its
demographic cousins (green circles) with contrasting forecasts: NM-03,
which pundits rate as strongly D-leaning, and TX-23, which most analysts
see as a safe R seat.
