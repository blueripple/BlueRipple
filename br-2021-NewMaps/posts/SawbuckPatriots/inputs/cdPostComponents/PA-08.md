The Blue Ripple model sees PA-08 as far more of a long shot for
Dems (41% D) than models based on historical data (50% D),
with demographics strongly in GOP territory (orange circles below).
That said, two somewhat related districts in nearby New York,
NY-19 and NY-22 (green circles), are both rated a bit more favorably
for Dems by pundits, so we think thereâ€™s hope for
Team Blue in PA-08 as well.
