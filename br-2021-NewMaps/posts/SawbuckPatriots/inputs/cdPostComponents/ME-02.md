From a data perspective, ME-02 is a bit of a unicorn–a demographically
R-like district that’s within striking distance for Dems.
Even though its low density, racial diversity, and college grad
fraction among white voters (orange circles below) put it squarely
in classic GOP territory, Blue Ripple’s model puts the district
at 45% D. That said, most districts with similar makeups to
ME-02 are safe R, with only a few slightly less-red exceptions
like IA-01 (green circles). In short, this district seems to
be more in-reach for Dems than its demographics would suggest,
and extra support could make the difference.
