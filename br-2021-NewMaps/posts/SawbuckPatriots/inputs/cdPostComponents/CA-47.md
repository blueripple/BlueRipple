CA-47 is rated as “lean Dem” by several pundits,
which fits with a model based on demographics and historical voting patterns (54% D).
The Blue Ripple model is even more optimistic about Team Blue’s chances,
rating it as 64% D. However, even though the district seems strongly Dem-leaning
based on its density and the college grad fraction among White voters,
that’s not the whole story. One reason for caution? The district is
demographically similar to CA-40, which is rated “likely Republican” by many analysts
and comes in at 47% D in a historical model.
