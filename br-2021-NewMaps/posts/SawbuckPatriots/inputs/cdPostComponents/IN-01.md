The Blue Ripple model sees IN-01 as 54% D, which is slightly
worse for Dems than suggested by models based on historical
data (58% D). That’s not entirely surprising: on all three
key demographic drivers in our model, the district ranges
from being on the left-hand edge of the Dem distribution to
deep in classic Republican territory (orange circles below).
There aren’t great demographic analogs to IN-01, unfortunately,
but one of the closest (kind of a “third cousin twice removed”)
is the lean/likely D district IL-13 – so we are encouraged.
