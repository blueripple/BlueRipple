From a data standpoint, IA-03 could be a welcome surprise for Dems:
despite its low density and racial diversity (orange circles below),
Blue Rippleâ€™s demographic model rates it as 56% D,
far stronger than what most pundits predict. With enough support,
one could easily imagine it moving to lean/likely D,
like its close demographic relative, OR-04 (green circles).
