The Blue Ripple model sees NC-13 as a decent opportunity for Dems (55% D)
that slightly outpaces what one might expect from historical data (51% D).
Its relatively high education level among white voters and racial diversity
appear to counterbalance its low density (orange circles below) to yield
a net Dem lean based on demographics. Team Blueâ€™s opportunity is to move
the needle in NC-13 closer to that of its nearby demographic cousin
NC-04 (green circles), which pundits and historical models suggest is likely/safe D.
