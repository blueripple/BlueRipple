Blue Ripple’s demographic model and historical data both put this district
at about 53% D. MN-02’s high percentage of college grads among white
voters seems to offset other factors one might expect to tilt the field
against Dems, like its low racial diversity and middling density
(orange circles below). The potential upside for Team Blue is
illustrated by a demographically similar midwest district,
WI-02 (green circles), which is generally regarded as safe D.
