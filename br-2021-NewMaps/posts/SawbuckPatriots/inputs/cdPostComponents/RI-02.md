RI-02 looks absolutely winnable by Dems in both Blue Ripple’s demographic
model (56% D) and historical models (58% D). Its relatively low racial
diversity is a negative factor for us, but this seems to be balanced
out by reasonable levels of density and education among white voters
(orange circles below), both of which favor Team Blue. However,
the risk to Dems in RI-02 is illustrated by its demographic cousin,
NE-01 (green circles), which is generally regarded as a safe
R seat–so despite our promising forecast, RI-02 may still be under threat.
