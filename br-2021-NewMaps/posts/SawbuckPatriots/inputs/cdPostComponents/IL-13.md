IL-13 is an extremely weird district to model: a D-winnable race with
R-like demographics. (In this way it is similar to ME-02,
which we covered previously.) Both Blue Ripple’s demographic model
and historical results put it at 56% D, despite its middling-to-low levels of
density, education among white voters, and racial diversity
(orange circles below). There aren’t many great demographic analogues
to IL-13, but the fact that one of its closest cousins is OH-10
(green circles), which is generally regarded as strongly
R-leaning, highlights the risk to Dems if we become complacent
