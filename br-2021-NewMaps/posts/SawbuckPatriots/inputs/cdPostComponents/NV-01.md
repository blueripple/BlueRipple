Blue Rippleâ€™s demographic model sees NV-01 as 55% D,
in line with estimates based on historical data.
Its high density and racial diversity push it toward Dems,
notwithstanding its low college grad percentage among white
voters (orange circles below). The opportunity for Team Blue
here is illustrated by CA-06, which has similar
demographics (green circles) but is rated safe D by pundits.
