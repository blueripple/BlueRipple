Blue Ripple’s demographic model is much more bullish on OH-01 (61% D)
than historical models (51% D) or pundits. Sure, it’s not a
particularly diverse district, but its high education level among
white voters and reasonable density (orange circles below) put it squarely
in Dem territory. And the fact that a demographically similar district,
MN-04 (green circles), is generally rated safe D is an encouraging
sign that OH-01 is winnable by Team Blue.
