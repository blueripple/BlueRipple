The Blue Ripple model sees CA-13 as evenly balanced (50% D),
which is a little more pessimistic than estimates based on
historical data (55% D). Yes, its high racial diversity would
suggest CA-13 is Dem-friendly, but its low density and level
of education among white voters (orange circles below) are
both cause for concern for Team Blue. That said, itâ€™s a
hopeful sign that its close demographic relative to the
north, CA-25, is rated safe D by pundits,
suggesting that Dems could mount a strong showing in CA-13 as well.
