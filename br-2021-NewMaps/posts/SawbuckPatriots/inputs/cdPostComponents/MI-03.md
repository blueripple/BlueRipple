Blue Ripple’s model puts MI-03 at 53% D, in line with historical voting patterns (52% D).
That’s not entirely surprising if you look at the district’s demographic
makeup (orange circles below): it’s on the rural side among D-leaning districts,
and its low percentage of voters of color puts it far outside the typical range
for Team Blue. MI-03 doesn’t have perfect analogs based on its population makeup,
but its nearest demographic cousins suggest it could flip either way
(green circles). Dems’ charge in November is to make the outcome more similar
to safe-D NJ-1, and not let it tip toward safe-R OK-05.
