From a demographic perspective, CA-40 looks like a plausible opportunity for Dems.
Although its voters have historically leaned rightward (47% D),
the district is relatively dense and diverse,
and a high fraction of voting-eligible Whites have college degrees.
Based on these factors, the Blue Ripple model suggests CA-40 should trend 61% Democratic,
in line with a district like NJ-6, which is demographically similar and has historically voted 60% D.
