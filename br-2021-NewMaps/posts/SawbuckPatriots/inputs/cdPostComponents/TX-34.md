Although pundits and historical models (62% D) see TX-34 as strongly D-leaning,
Blue Ripple’s demographic model has a more cautious take for Dems (50% D).
Despite being a majority non-white district, its low density and education
level among white voters bring it closer to GOP territory (orange circles below).
Looking at demographically similar districts (green circles), TX-34 could side
with Team Blue like TX-28 … or go into the strong R camp alongside FL-26.
We’re optimistic about the former, but think support is needed to prevent
the latter.
