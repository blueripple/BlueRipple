Blue Ripple’s analysis suggests many pundits are
over-estimating Dems’ chances in PA-06.
Its high college grad fraction among White
voters is somewhat offset by its middling density
and low fraction of voters of color (yellow circles
in the figure below), leading us to calculate it
as a toss-up (52% D). In this regard, a cautionary
indicator with similar demographics is NJ-07
(green circles below), which we also see as down
to the wire, and most pundits rate between toss-up
and likely R.
