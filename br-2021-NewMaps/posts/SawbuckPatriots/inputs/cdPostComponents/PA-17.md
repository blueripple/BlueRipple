PA-17 looks pretty safe in historical models (55% D), but Blue Ripple’s
demographic model suggests it’s more at-risk than advertised (50% D).
Notwithstanding the high fraction of college grads among white voters,
the district has almost no racial diversity and has middling density,
both of which drag it into GOP-friendly territory (orange circles below).
That said, CT-02 is similarly non-diverse and even worse for Dems
on other key measures (green circles), yet rated much more strongly
D-leaning by analysts, so there’s reason for optimism.
