The Blue Ripple model sees TX-28 as a legit toss-up (50% D),
which is slightly more pessimistic than one would expect from
historical data (56% D). Despite its high racial diversity,
the districtâ€™s low density and level of education among white
voters (orange circles below) appear to drag the demographic
prediction toward Republicans. That said, its voting
population is demographically similar to that of nearby TX-34
(green circles), which most pundits rate lean/likely D,
so we believe there is an opportunity for Dems in the 28th district as well.
