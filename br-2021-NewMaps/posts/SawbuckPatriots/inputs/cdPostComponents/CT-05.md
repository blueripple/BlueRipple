CT-05 is a legit toss-up that shows up as ever-so-slightly Dem-leaning
in both our Blue Ripple model (54% D) and a model based on historical
results (53% D). In terms of the main factors driving it red vs. blue,
itâ€™s middle-of-the-road in terms of both density and voters-of-color,
but the high college grad fraction among White voters drives it toward
Team Blue. To illustrate its potential, MA-03 is a safe Dem district
(70% based on historical results) that has extremely similar demographics
to CT-05 on all of those dimensions.
