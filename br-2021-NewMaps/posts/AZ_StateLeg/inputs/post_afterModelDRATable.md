We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-4 point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking and all models have some uncertainty which we acknowledge
by widening the range an extra point on both sides.

With those preliminaries in mind,
here are a few observations on the new AZ state-house districts:

1. Unexpected findings – pickup opportunities for Dem donors (2)

    - Our model shows strong D performance is possible in AZ-14 and AZ-27 though the historical model sees them
    both as safe R.
    - We also see strong D possibilities in AZ-2, AZ-4 and AZ-13 while the historical model sees them as Lean R.
    - And we see some hope in AZ-10 and AZ-29, where the historical model sees them as safe R but we see Lean D

2. Unexpected findings – potential longer-term defense opportunities for Dem donors (2)

   - There are also places where we are concerned that historically safe-looking districts might be in need of
   defense. In particular, AZ-21 where we see R+1 and AZ-23 where we see R+4.

3. Expected findings – known high-priority races for Dem Donors (1)

    - TX-15 is rated by historical models as lean D (D+2), whereas our model sees it as likely R (R+5).
    This is probably for the same reasons as the vulnerability noted above for districts with large numbers
    of Hispanic voters.

4. Unexpected findings – but low-priority for Dem donors (4)

    - Four districts look competitive in our model (TX-2, TX-3, TX-12, TX-22),
    at R+5 or a bit closer, but for all of them the historical model looks like safe R (R+10 or more).
    Although we think these may be far less GOP-leaning than historical results suggest,
    they all seem much harder to flip than TX-24 and TX-38.
    We’re keeping an eye on them, but recommend de-prioritizing them for now.


5. Expected findings – safe D and safe R districts (29)

    - Several TX districts are clearly far outside the range and don’t merit
    serious investment by Dems looking to maximize their impact.

    - Both the demographic model and the historical model agree that there are 11 safe D
    districts (TX-7, TX-9, TX-16, TX-18, TX-20, TX-29, TX-30, TX-32, TX-33, TX-35
    TX-37), though our model sees them as slightly less safe
    than the historical model.

    - Both models also agree that there are 18 safe R districts (TX-1, TX-4, TX-5, TX-6, TX-8, TX-10,
    TX-11, TX-13, TX-14, TX-17, TX-19, TX-21, TX-23, TX-25, TX-26, TX-27, TX-31, TX-36),
    though our model sees some of them as somewhat more competitive than the historical model.

This might be clearer in a table, here sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
