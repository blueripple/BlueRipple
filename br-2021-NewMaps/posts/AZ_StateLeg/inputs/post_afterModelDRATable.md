We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-4 point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking and all models have some uncertainty which we acknowledge
by widening the range an extra point on both sides.

With those preliminaries in mind,
here are a few observations on the new AZ state-house districts:

1. Unexpected findings – pickup opportunities for Dem donors (2)

    - Our model shows strong D performance is possible in AZ-14 and AZ-27 though the historical model sees them
    both as safe R.

2. Unexpected findings – potential longer-term defense opportunities for Dem donors (2)

   - There are also places where we are concerned that historically safe-looking districts might be in need of
   defense. In particular, AZ-21 where we see D+1 and AZ-23 where we see R+2.

3. Expected findings – known high-priority races for Dem Donors (3)

    - AZ-13, AZ-2, AZ-4 all look like races D’s can win.  Historically slightly R but demographically lean D.

4. Unexpected findings – but low-priority for Dem donors (2)

    - AZ-10, AZ-29 are both safe R historically but look slightly D from a demographic point of view.
      Perhaps worth looking at if a particularly strong candidate were running.

Below we show the demographics of all these districts in two ways. First broken down
by specific race/ethnicity and education categories and then with somewhat less detail but more
structure, in a chart showing where each district lies in terms of % voters-of-color and
% college-graduates. In both cases, we show density on the charts as well.
