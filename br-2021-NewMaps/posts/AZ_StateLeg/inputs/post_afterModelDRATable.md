We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-4 point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking and all models have some uncertainty which we acknowledge
by widening the range an extra point on both sides.

With those preliminaries in mind,
here are a few observations on the new AZ state-house districts:

1. Unexpected findings – pickup opportunities for Dem donors (2)

    - Our model shows strong D performance is possible in AZ-14, AZ-27 and AZ-29 though the historical model sees them
    as safe R. AZ-14 and AZ-27 overlap with Congressional districts which are also competitive, making donations to them
    even more useful.

2. Unexpected findings – potential defense opportunities for Dem donors (3)

   - There are also places where we are concerned that historically safe-looking districts might be in need of
   defense. In particular, AZ-18 where we see R+1 vs the historical D+10. AZ-8 and AZ-12 are both safe D historically
   but we see both as within striking distance for Rs. All of these districts overlap
   competitive Congressional districts as well.

3. Expected findings – known high-priority races for Dem Donors (5)

    - AZ-2, AZ-4, AZ-9, AZ-13, and AZ-16 all look like races D’s can win.  Ranging from D+1 to R+3 historically
    and D+3 to R+3 in our model. All of these districts also overlap with competitive Congressional districts.
