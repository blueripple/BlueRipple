We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-4 point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking and all models have some uncertainty which we acknowledge
by widening the range an extra point on both sides.

From our point of view, AZ state-leg is a simple for donors: give to all 3 candidates
in each of AZ-2, AZ-4, AZ-9, AZ-12, AZ-13, AZ-27, AZ-29. We might also throw in AZ-14
because it is just barely “implausible” and it has overlap with Arizona’s 5th congressional
district where there is a slim possibility that the Dem candidate, Javier Ramos, can pull
off an upset if the formerly-Republican independent can siphon enough votes from the
incumbent Republican.

## 2. Coda #1: Demographics of new AZ districts
One thing we haven’t seen discussed very much is how redistricting in AZ
has changed the demographics in each state-house district.
As a way of putting the
demographic model results in context, let’s look at the underlying
population two different ways:

- The first chart below shows each 2022 state-house district,
with the population broken down by race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, Asian,
white-non-Hispanic and other) and education (College Grad and non-College Grad).
Each bar also has a dot representing the (logarithmic) population density[^popDens]
of the district.
The scale for that dot is on the right-side axis of the chart.
For reference, a log density of 5 represents about 150 people per square mile and a
log density of 8 represents about 3000 people per square mile.
We’ve ordered the districts by D-share based on our demographic model,
which is helpful for understanding how the model responds to demographics and density.

- In the second chart, we look at these demographics a different way,
placing each district according to its proportion of college graduates
and non-white citizens of voting age. We also indicate (logarithmic)
population density via the size of the circle and modeled D-edge (D-share minus 50%)
via color. This makes it easier to see that the model predicts larger D vote-share
as the district becomes more educated, more non-White and more dense.

[^popDens]: We use logarithms here because
density varies tremendously over districts, from tens to hundreds of thousands of people per square mile.
We use population-weighting because the resulting average more closely expresses
the density of where people actually live.  For example, consider a district made up of a high-density
city where 90% of the population live and then large but low-density exurbs where the other 10% live.
Most people in that district live at high density and we want our density to reflect that even though
the unweighted average density (people/district size) might be smaller.
