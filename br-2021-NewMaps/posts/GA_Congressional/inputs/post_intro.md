# New Maps, New Dem Strategy: Our GA Analysis

The 2022 Congressional elections will involve new district maps in
all 50 states.
Districts will be reshaped, created, and eliminated,
which will change Dems’ odds in each race.
How can donors figure out which races have the biggest “bang for buck”
for flipping tenuous GOP seats or protecting vulnerable Dems?

To help answer that question, we’ve been building and refining a demographic
model that predicts Democratic lean in each district based on its
makeup in terms of race, sex, education, and population density.
We then compare those results to an existing model based on historical
data to help Dem donors identify races that we think deserve support
for “offense” or “defense”.

In this post, we’re focusing on Georgia. Here’s what we’ll cover:

1. Dem-lean by district in GA: our demographic model vs. historical data
2. Districts worthy of Dem donor support
3. Coming next from Blue Ripple
4. Coda #1: Demographics of the new GA districts
5. Coda #2: Brief intro to our methods (for non-experts)

## 1. Dem-lean by district in GA: our demographic model vs. historical data

Our “demographic” model forecasts the potential Democratic lean of each
new district in GA based on attributes like race, education, age, and
population density. In the graph and table below,
we compare our predictions to a “historical” model (from the excellent
[Dave’s Redistricting (DR) web-site][DavesR]) built up from precinct-level
results in prior elections[^voteShare]. (See methods at the end of this post for more details.)
The axes show the projected 2-party Dem vote share with each model.
The diagonal line represents where districts would fall on this scatter-plot
if the two models agreed precisely. In districts to the left of the line,
our demographic model thinks the D vote share is higher than historical results,
and to the right of the line, we think it’s lower than the historical model predicts[^old].

[^old]: We’ve also done this modeling for the old districts and compared that
result to the actual 2020 election results. See [here][oldDistricts].

[^voteShare]: One important note about the numbers. Dave’s Redistricting gives
estimates of Democratic candidate votes, Republican candidate votes and votes
for other candidates.  We’ve taken those numbers and computed 2-party vote share
for the Democratic candidate, that is, D Votes/(D Votes + R Votes). That makes it
comparable with the Demographic model which also produces 2-party vote share.
