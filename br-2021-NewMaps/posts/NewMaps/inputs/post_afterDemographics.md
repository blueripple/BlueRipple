Just looking at that chart you might have guesses about which of these districts are safely Democratic and which
might be safely Republican, based solely on the proportion of voters-of-color.  And you’d be mostly correct.
Below we chart the election results along with our model results as an XY scatter plot with the election result
on the y-axis, the model result on the x-axis and a line representing where each district would fall if the model
and election result agreed precisely.  We don’t expect that, of course, but we hope to see reasonable agreement in most
districts if the model is to be of any use!
