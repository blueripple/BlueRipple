# Blue Ripple Model and NC’s new Congressional Map

I’m putting this together as a quick note to Dale (and the rest of the Force Multiplier research team)
about NC and the new congressional map.  During our last conversation we spoke about looking at new
maps as they come out and seeing if our view is at all useful for your candidate selection work.

We’ve spent some time on this since then, mostly doing the preliminary work of figuring out where to
find new maps, finding sources for good conventional analysis and updating our data sources where
applicable.

A few notes:

- Our model is entirely demographic and geographic. We use turnout and voting data
(from the CCES survey) based on education, sex, race, population density and state
to estimate  expected turnout and voter preference for various types people in
each state.  Then we look at the demographics of a particular district, breaking it down
into the same categories and then using our model to estimate the 2-party vote share we
expect for a democratic candidate.
