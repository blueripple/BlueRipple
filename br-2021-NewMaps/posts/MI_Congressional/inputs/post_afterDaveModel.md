We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model and 47-53% in the historical model.
That’s because we think a 3-point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking. Our demographic model carries some
additional uncertainties, so we expand the range a bit there.  Our methodology for
using our model and the historical data to classify districts is explained
[in this post][BRMethodology].

With that in mind,  here are a few observations on the new MI districts:

- First, let’s dispense with the obvious ones. Several MI districts are clearly
  far outside the competitive range and don’t merit serious investment by Dems
  looking to maximize their impact. Both the demographic model and the historical
  model agree that MI-6, MI-11, MI-12 and MI-13 are safe D.
  Both models also agree that MI-1, MI-2, MI-5 and MI-9 are far out of reach for Dems.

- We think the rest are competitive, though the models disagree about the lean of various
  districts.

Here’s a different look at the data, in a table sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
