Itâ€™s hard to see anything specific from these charts, though we are
continuing to examine them as we try to understand what might be happening
in each specific district. Overall, our impression is that this new map in TX
has made the safe D districts safer by adding voters-of-color
(mostly Hispanic and Black voters but also some Asian voters) and thus
made the rest of the districts easier for Republicans to win by removing those
same voters from places where they might have made districts competitive.
