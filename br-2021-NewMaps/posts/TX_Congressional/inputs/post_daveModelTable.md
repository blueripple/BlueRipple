## 2. Districts worthy of Dem donor support
Based on the results above, we think there are five good options
for Dem donors in TX: TX-15, TX-28, TX-34, TX-38 and TX-24.

- TX-15 is competitive in both models and we think a slight lean R but winnable for the Dems.
- TX-28 and TX-34 might look safe, but we are concerned that these could be hard to win,
especially in a bad year for team Blue.
- TX-38 and TX-24 are, perhaps, “plausible long-shots”, districts that look out-of-reach
historically but winnable demographically.  These are places where resources now,
especially spent on organizing, could make a large difference.

Our findings in TX-38 and TX-24 deserve particular discussion. These look to be "safe R"
given the voting patterns in the precincts within them,
but our demographic model suggests they should be much more Dem-leaning, and maybe even Dem-winnable.
What might this mean? One way to answer this question is to consider the difference between the two models.
Our demographic model asks: if the voting-age citizens of this district turned out and voted like similar people
in other parts of the country and state,  what would we expect the outcome of this election to be?
Whereas the historical model asks how we'd expect the election to turn out if the voters in this district turn out and
vote as they have in previous elections. This points to a few possible reasons why a historically
deep-red district like TX-38 might look flippable in our model -- including, but not limited to, the following:

- Our model may be wrong about how we define "similar" voters. We've incorporated factors like education and race,
but maybe we've missed key things that make voters in TX-38
different from superficially "similar" voters in other districts nationwide.

- Location-specific factors may depress Dem voting. It's possible that barriers related to voter
access in TX-38 depress Dem vote share below what it would be in other districts.

- Dems may, in fact, have underperformed relative to their potential among these voters.
It's possible that more effective candidate recruitment, campaigning,
or organizing could, in fact, yield a win for Dems in TX-38 or TX-24.

We don't know which (if any) of these explanations is correct.
But our model suggests that if you want to support Team Blue in TX,
and are open to the idea of supporting some long-shot candidates,
then donating to a Dem in TX-38 or TX-24 might fit the bill.

Finally, a few overarching observations.
As with many gerrymandered maps, this one makes the minority party very
safe in their small number of districts and the majority somewhat less safe in theirs.
Although the historical analysis has most of the R districts about
R+15 to R+20 our demographic model sees most of them as much closer,
between R+10 and R+5. That means that in a wave election favoring Dems–admittedly
not likely in 2022, but you never know!–this map might be surprisingly risky for Republicans.
And for Dem donors, it points to several giving opportunities that could help move
the needle in 2022 or future elections.

If the map changes (there is [ongoing litigation][TXSuit]) or we update the model enough
to significantly shift our view on any of this, we’ll update this note (and let you know).

## 3.	Coming next from Blue Ripple

Here’s where we’re planning to take these analyses over the next few months:

- We’re going to do the same type analysis in many (all?) of the states,
in order to identify the best options for Dem donors in 2022 on both
offense and defense nationwide.
- We’re going to continue to refine and improve our demographic model–we’ll
update this post and others as we do so. Feel free to contact us if you want
more details on the mechanics, or if you’d like to propose changes or improvements.
- As maps get solidified, we’ll set up ActBlue donation links for candidates
(after the primaries) to make it easy for you to donate.

If you want to stay up-to-date, please sign up for our email updates!
We’re also on Twitter, Facebook, and Github.

## 4. Coda #1: Demographics of new TX districts
One thing we haven’t seen discussed very much is how redistricting in TX
has changed the demographics in each district. As a way of putting the
demographic model results in context, let’s look at the underlying
population two different ways:

- The first chart below shows each of TX’s proposed 2022 districts,
with the population broken down by race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, Asian,
white-non-Hispanic and other) and education (College Grad and non-College Grad).
Each bar also has a dot representing the (logarithmic) population density[^popDens]
of the district.
The scale for that dot is on the right-side axis of the chart.
For reference, a log density of 5 represents about 150 people per square mile and a
log density of 8 represents about 3000 people per square mile.
We’ve ordered the districts by D-share based on our demographic model,
which is helpful for understanding how the model responds to demographics and density.

- In the second chart, we look at these demographics a different way,
placing each TX district according to its proportion of college graduates
and non-white citizens of voting age. We also indicate (logarithmic)
population density via the size of the circle and modeled D-edge (D-share minus 50%)
via color. This makes it easier to see that the model predicts larger D vote-share
as the district becomes more educated, more non-white and more dense.

[^popDens]: We use logarithms here because
density varies tremendously over districts, from tens to hundreds of thousands of people per square mile.
We use population-weighting because the resulting average more closely expresses
the density of where people actually live.  For example, consider a district made up of a high-density
city where 90% of the population live and then large but low-density exurbs where the other 10% live.
Most people in that district live at high density and we want our density to reflect that even though
the unweighted average density (people/district size) might be smaller.
