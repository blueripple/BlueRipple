The model seems to capture the trends pretty well, though it has some significant misses[^misses].
We’re most interested in districts between 45% and 55%, and in that range the model does pretty well,
though it tends to be more optimisitc about Dem chances then was the reality in the 2020 election.

[^misses]:We’re not convinced that we are handling population density as well as we could.  Even on
a log scale, the variation is large and very different state-to-state.  We’ve worked on this some
without any simple solution.
If we make significant progress there, we’ll update this note.
