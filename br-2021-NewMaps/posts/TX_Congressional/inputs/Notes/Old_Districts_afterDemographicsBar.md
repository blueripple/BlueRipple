Below we look at these demographics a different way.  We place each district according to its
proportion of college graduates and non-white citizens of voting age.  We also indicate
(logarithmic) population density via the size of the circle and modeled D-edge (D-share - 50%)
via color. This makes it easier to see that the model predicts larger D vote share as the
district becomes more educated, more non-white and more dense.
