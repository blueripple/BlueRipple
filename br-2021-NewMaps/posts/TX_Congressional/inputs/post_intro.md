# New Congressional Maps, New Dem Strategy: Our TX Analysis

Like all states, Texas is locking down new disrict maps, which affect
Democrat’s odds in 2022 COngressional races. In this reshaped landscape,
how can donors focus their attention on races with the biggest “bang for buck”
for flipping tenuous GOP seats or protecting vulnerable Dems?

To help answer that question, we’ve continued to build and refine
a demographic
model that predicts Democratic lean in each district based on its
makeup in terms of race, sex, education, and population density.
We then compare those results to an existing model based on historical
data to help Dem donors identify races that we think deserve support
for “offense” or “defense”.

This post focuses on Texas. (If you’re interested in other states,
check out [our analysis of NC][NCPost].) Here’s what we’ll cover:

## 1. Dem-lean by district in TX: our demographic model vs. historical data

*Introduction:* (Feel free to skip this part if you’ve already read our prior state analyses.)
Our “demographic” model forecasts the potential Democratic lean of each
new district in TX based on attributes like race, education, age, and
population density. In the graph and table below,
we compare our predictions to a “historical” model (from the excellent
[Dave’s Redistricting (DR) web-site][DavesR]) built up from precinct-level
results in prior elections[^voteShare]. (See methods at the end of this post for more details.)
The axes show the projected 2-party Dem vote share with each model.
The diagonal line represents where districts would fall on this scatter-plot
if the two models agreed precisely. In districts to the left of the line,
our demographic model thinks the D vote share is higher than historical results,
and to the right of the line, we think it’s lower than the historical model predicts.

[^voteShare]: One important note about the numbers. Dave’s Redistricting gives
estimates of Democratic candidate votes, Republican candidate votes and votes
for other candidates.  We’ve taken those numbers and computed 2-party vote share
for the Democratic candidate, that is, D Votes/(D Votes + R Votes). That makes it
comparable with the Demographic model which also produces 2-party vote share.
