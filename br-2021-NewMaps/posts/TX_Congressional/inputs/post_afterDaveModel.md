We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-4 point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking and all models have some uncertainty which we acknowledge
by widening the range an extra point on both sides. Our methodology for
using our model and the historical data to classify districts is explained
[in this post][BRMethodology].

TX-specific findings: With those preliminaries in mind,
here are a few observations on the new TX districts:

1. Unexpected findings – high-priority pickup opportunities for Dem donors (2)

    - The most surprising and consequential disagreements our model and the historical one are in TX-24 and TX-38.
   We see TX-24 and TX-38 as lean D (D+2) but the historical model sees them as R+10 or more.
   These are both relatively dense, majority-white districts near cities (TX-24 contains parts of
   Dallas and TX-38 contains parts of Houston). We believe these may be worthy of consideration by donors
   as “plausible long-shots,” despite their historical GOP bent – more on them later.

2. Unexpected findings – potential longer-term defense opportunities for Dem donors (2)

   - We also found two districts that we think need more defense than suggested by prior results.
   The historical model sees TX-34 as D+12 but our model is much less sure (tossup),
   the historical model estimates TX-28 as D+6 where we also see a tossup.
   Both districts are majority Hispanic and the model has significant uncertainty about the
   preference of Hispanic voters. This uncertainty stems from the large range of election outcomes in majority
   Hispanic districts throughout the country and TX.

3. Expected findings – known high-priority races for Dem Donors (1)

    - TX-15 is rated by historical models as lean D (D+2), whereas our model sees it as a R+4. We think
    this district is extremely vulnerable. But since it is conventionally rated as a tossup, we also think it
    will get plenty of attention from all sorts of donors.

4. Unexpected findings – but low-priority for Dem donors (8)

    - Five districts look competitive in our model (TX-2, TX-3, TX-12, TX-22, TX-26),
    at R+5 or closer, but for all of them the historical model looks like safe R (R+10 or more).
    Although we think these may be far less GOP-leaning than historical results suggest,
    they all seem much harder to flip than TX-24 and TX-38.
    We’re keeping an eye on them, but recommend de-prioritizing them for now.

    - 3 Districts look vulnerable in our model but very safe historically. For all three
    we are keeping an eye on the margins but we expect them to be safe D and thus not
    useful places for donors to focus on.

      - TX-16 is D+20 historically but only D+5 in our model
      - TX-35 is D+23 historically but only D+5 in our model
      - TX-37 is D+26 historically but only D+4 in our model

5. Expected findings – safe D and safe R districts (25)

    - Several TX districts are clearly far outside the range and don’t merit
    serious investment by Dems looking to maximize their impact.

    - Both the demographic model and the historical model agree that there are 8 safe D
    districts (TX-7, TX-9, TX-16, TX-18, TX-20, TX-29, TX-30, TX-32, TX-33),
    though our model sees them as slightly less safe
    than the historical model.

    - Both models also agree that there are 17 safe R districts (TX-1, TX-4, TX-5, TX-6, TX-8,
    TX-10, TX-11, TX-13, TX-14, TX-17, TX-19, TX-21, TX-23, TX-25, TX-27, TX-31, TX-36),
    though our model sees some of them as somewhat more competitive than the historical model.

This might be clearer in a table, here sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
