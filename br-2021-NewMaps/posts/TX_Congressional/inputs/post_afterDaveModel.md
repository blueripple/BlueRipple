We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-4 point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking and all models have some uncertainty which we acknowledge
by widening the range an extra point on both sides.

TX-specific findings: With those preliminaries in mind,
here are a few observations on the new TX districts:

1. Unexpected findings – high-priority pickup opportunities for Dem donors (2)

    - The most surprising and consequential disagreements our model and the historical one are in TX-24 and TX-38.
   We see TX-24 and TX-38 as toss-ups but the historical model sees them as R+10 or more.
   These are both relatively dense, majority-white districts near cities (TX-24 contains parts of
   Dallas and TX-38 contains parts of Houston). We believe these may be worthy of consideration by donors
   as “plausible long-shots,” despite their historical GOP bent – more on them later.

2. Unexpected findings – potential longer-term defense opportunities for Dem donors (2)

   - We also found three districts that we think need more defense than suggested by prior results.
   The historical model sees TX-34 as D+12 but our model is much less sure (toss-up),
   the historical model estimates TX-28 as D+6 where we see a toss-up as well. We think these are
   a result of the shift in 2020 voter preference among Hispanic voters.  If that holds in 2022,
   many historically safe districts could be vulnerable.

3. Expected findings – known high-priority races for Dem Donors (1)

    - TX-15 is rated by historical models as lean D (D+2), whereas our model sees it as likely R (R+5).
    This is probably for the same reasons as the vulnerability noted above for districts with large numbers
    of Hispanic voters.

4. Unexpected findings – but low-priority for Dem donors (4)

    - Four districts look competitive in our model (TX-2, TX-3, TX-12, TX-22),
    at R+5 or a bit closer, but for all of them the historical model looks like safe R (R+10 or more).
    Although we think these may be far less GOP-leaning than historical results suggest,
    they all seem much harder to flip than TX-24 and TX-38.
    We’re keeping an eye on them, but recommend de-prioritizing them for now.


5. Expected findings – safe D and safe R districts (29)

    - Several TX districts are clearly far outside the range and don’t merit
    serious investment by Dems looking to maximize their impact.

    - Both the demographic model and the historical model agree that there are 11 safe D
    districts (TX-7, TX-9, TX-16, TX-18, TX-20, TX-29, TX-30, TX-32, TX-33, TX-35
    TX-37), though our model sees them as slightly less safe
    than the historical model.

    - Both models also agree that there are 18 safe R districts (TX-1, TX-4, TX-5, TX-6, TX-8, TX-10,
    TX-11, TX-13, TX-14, TX-17, TX-19, TX-21, TX-23, TX-25, TX-26, TX-27, TX-31, TX-36),
    though our model sees some of them as somewhat more competitive than the historical model.

This might be clearer in a table, here sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
