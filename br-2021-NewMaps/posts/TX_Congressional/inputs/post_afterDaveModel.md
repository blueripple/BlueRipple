We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 47-53% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking.

With that in mind,  here are a few observations on the new TX districts:

- First, let’s dispense with the obvious ones. Several TX districts are clearly
far outside the 3-point range and don’t merit serious investment by Dems
looking to maximize their impact. Both the demographic model and the historical
model agree that there are 11 safe D districts (TX-9, TX-30, TX-18, TX-7, TX-29,
TX-33, TX-32, TX-21, TX-16, TX-35, and TX-37), though our model sees them as slightly less safe
than the historical model.
Both models also agree that there are 14 safe R districts (TX-13, TX-1, TX-19, TX-10,
TX-17, TX-31, TX-21, TX-4, TX-27, TX-25, TX-36, TX-11, TX-6, and TX-5), though our model sees most
of them as somewhat more competitive than the historical model.
- The historical model suggests that TX-23 is competitive (R+4), but our model sees it as R+11, a safe R.
- The most surprising and consequential disagreement is in TX-24 and TX-28: our model sees these as D+5
but the historical model sees them as R+10 or more. These are both relatively dense, majority-white districts
near cities (TX-24 contains parts of Dallas and TX-38 contains parts of Houston).
- The historical model sees TX-28 and TX-34 as safe D (D+6 or more) but our model is less sure (D+3 for both).
- The only remaining lean D (D+2) in the historical model is TX-15 which our model sees as R+1. We agree
that it’s competitive but disagree some about the current lean.
- There are a bundle of districts (TX-2, TX-3, TX-12, TX-22, TX-8, TX-26, and TX-14) which we see as competitive,
varying from even to R+3, but all of which the historical model sees as safe R (R+10 or more).

Here’s a different look at the data, in a table sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
