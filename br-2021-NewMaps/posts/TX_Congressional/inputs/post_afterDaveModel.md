We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 47-53% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking.

TX-specific findings: With those preliminaries in mind,
here are a few observations on the new TX districts:

1. Expected findings – safe D and safe R districts
   - Several TX districts are clearly far outside the 3-point range and don’t merit
   serious investment by Dems looking to maximize their impact.
   Both the demographic model and the historical model agree that there are 12 safe D
   districts (TX-9, TX-30, TX-18, TX-29, TX-7, TX-33, TX-32, TX-29, TX-20, TX-16,
   TX-37, and TX-35), though our model sees them as slightly less safe
   than the historical model.

   - Both models also agree that there are 14 safe R districts (TX-1, TX-13, TX-19,
   TX-10, TX-17, TX-27, TX-4, TX-31, TX-21, TX-25, TX-36, TX-5, TX-6, TX-11),
   though our model sees most of them as somewhat more competitive than the historical model.

   - In addition, The historical model suggests that TX-23 is competitive (R+4),
   but our model sees it as R+9, a safe R. We would therefore de-prioritize it for donors.

2. Expected findings – tight districts
   - TX-15 is rated by historical models as lean D (D+2), whereas our model sees it as even.
   We agree that it’s competitive and recommend it for support, even though we have a minor disagreement about the current lean.

3. Unexpected findings – potential new opportunitied for Dem donors
   - The most surprising and consequential disagreements our model and the historical one are in TX-24 and TX-38.
   We see TX-24 as D+7 and TX-38 as D+8 but the historical model sees them as R+10 or more.
   These are both relatively dense, majority-white districts near cities (TX-24 contains parts of
   Dallas and TX-38 contains parts of Houston). We believe these may be worthy of consideration by donors
   as “plausible long-shots,” despite their historical GOP bent – more on them later.

   - Several other districts look competitive in our model (TX-3, TX-2, TX-12, TX-22, TX-26, TX-8, TX-14, TX-11),
   varying from D+2 to R+4, but for all of them the historical model looks like safe R (R+10 or more).
   Although we think these may be far less GOP-leaning than historical results suggest,
   they all seem much harder to flip than TX-24 and TX-38.
   We’re keeping an eye on them, but recommend deprioritizing them for now.

   - We found two districts that we think need more defense than suggested by prior results.
   The historical model sees TX-34 as D+12 but our model is much less sure (D+3).
   In a similar vein, but to a lesser extent, the historical model calculates TX-28 as D+6 where we see D+4.

This might be clearer in a table, here sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
