We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 47-53% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking.

TX-specific findings: With those preliminaries in mind,
here are a few observations on the new TX districts:

1. Unexpected findings – potential new opportunities for Dem donors (4)

    - The most surprising and consequential disagreements our model and the historical one are in TX-24 and TX-38.
   We see TX-24 as D+7 and TX-38 as D+8 but the historical model sees them as R+10 or more.
   These are both relatively dense, majority-white districts near cities (TX-24 contains parts of
   Dallas and TX-38 contains parts of Houston). We believe these may be worthy of consideration by donors
   as “plausible long-shots,” despite their historical GOP bent – more on them later.

   - We also found three districts that we think need more defense than suggested by prior results.
   The historical model sees TX-34 as D+12 but our model is much less sure (D+2),
   the historical model calculates TX-28 as D+6 where we see D+3,
   and we see only D+2 for TX-35 where the historical model sees D+24. We think these are all
   a result of the shift in 2020 voter preference among Hispanic voters.  If that holds in 2022,
   many historically safe districts are vulnerable.

2. Expected findings – known opportunities for Dem Donors (1)

    - TX-15 is rated by historical models as lean D (D+2), whereas our model sees it as safe R (R+7).
    This is likely for the same reasons as the vulnerability noted above for districts with large numbers
    of Hispanic voters.

3. Unexpected findings – but low-priority for Dem donors (8)

    - Seven districts look competitive in our model (TX-2, TX-3, TX-8, TX-12, TX-14, TX-22, TX-26),
    varying from D+2 to R+4, but for all of them the historical model looks like safe R (R+10 or more).
    Although we think these may be far less GOP-leaning than historical results suggest,
    they all seem much harder to flip than TX-24 and TX-38.
    We’re keeping an eye on them, but recommend de-prioritizing them for now.

    - The historical model suggests that TX-23 is lean R (R+3),
    but our model sees it as R+9.  We would therefore classify it as “safe R”
    and de-prioritize it for donors.

4. Expected findings – safe D and safe R districts (25)

    - Several TX districts are clearly far outside the 3-point range and don’t merit
    serious investment by Dems looking to maximize their impact.

    - Both the demographic model and the historical model agree that there are 10 safe D
    districts (TX-7, TX-9, TX-16, TX-18, TX-20, TX-29, TX-30, TX-32, TX-33,
    TX-37), though our model sees them as slightly less safe
    than the historical model.

    - Both models also agree that there are 14 safe R districts (TX-1, TX-4, TX-5, TX-6, TX-10,
    TX-11, TX-13, TX-17, TX-19, TX-21, TX-25, TX-27, TX-31, TX-36),
    though our model sees most of them as somewhat more competitive than the historical model.

This might be clearer in a table, here sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
