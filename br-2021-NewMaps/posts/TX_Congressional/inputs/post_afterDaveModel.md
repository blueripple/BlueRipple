We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 47-53% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking.

With that in mind,  here are a few observations on the new TX districts:

- First, let’s dispense with the obvious ones. Several TX districts are clearly
far outside the 3-point range and don’t merit serious investment by Dems
looking to maximize their impact. Both the demographic model and the historical
model agree that there are 12 safe D districts (TX-9, TX-30, TX-18, TX-29, TX-7,
TX-33, TX-32, TX-29, TX-20, TX-16, TX-37, and TX-35), though our model sees them as slightly less safe
than the historical model.
Both models also agree that there are 11 safe R districts (TX-13, TX-1, TX-19,
TX-10, TX-17, TX-31, TX-27, TX-4, TX-21, TX-25, TX-36), though our model sees most
of them as somewhat more competitive than the historical model.
- The historical model suggests that TX-23 is competitive (R+4), but our model sees it as R+9, a safe R.
- The most surprising and consequential disagreement is in TX-24 and TX-38: our model sees these as D+7
but the historical model sees them as R+10 or more. These are both relatively dense, majority-white districts
near cities (TX-24 contains parts of Dallas and TX-38 contains parts of Houston).
- The historical model sees TX-34 as D+12 but our model is less sure (D+3), and TX-28 as D+6 where we see D+4.
- The only remaining lean D (D+2) in the historical model is TX-15 which our model sees as even. We agree
that it’s competitive but disagree some about the current lean.
- There are a bundle of districts (TX-3, TX-2, TX-12, TX-26, TX-8, TX-14, TX-11, TX-6, TX-5)
which we see as competitive, varying from D+4 to R+4, but all of which the historical model sees as safe R (R+10 or more).

This might be clearer in a table, here sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
