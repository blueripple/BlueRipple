We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-4 point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking and all models have some uncertainty which we acknowledge
by widening the range an extra point on both sides.

TX-specific findings: With those preliminaries in mind,
here are a few observations on the new TX districts:

1. Unexpected findings – potential new opportunities for Dem donors (4)

    - The most surprising and consequential disagreements our model and the historical one are in TX-24 and TX-38.
   We see TX-24 and TX-38 as toss-ups but the historical model sees them as R+10 or more.
   These are both relatively dense, majority-white districts near cities (TX-24 contains parts of
   Dallas and TX-38 contains parts of Houston). We believe these may be worthy of consideration by donors
   as “plausible long-shots,” despite their historical GOP bent – more on them later.

   - We also found three districts that we think need more defense than suggested by prior results.
   The historical model sees TX-34 as D+12 but our model is much less sure (toss-up),
   the historical model estimates TX-28 as D+6 where we see a toss-up,
   and we see only D+5 for TX-35 where the historical model sees D+24. We think these are all
   a result of the shift in 2020 voter preference among Hispanic voters.  If that holds in 2022,
   many historically safe districts are vulnerable.  We’re also keeping an eye on TX-37 which looks
   very safe (D+26) by voting history but is a toss-up/lean D (D+2) in our model.

2. Expected findings – known opportunities for Dem Donors (1)

    - TX-15 is rated by historical models as lean D (D+2), whereas our model sees it as likely R (R+5).
    This is probably for the same reasons as the vulnerability noted above for districts with large numbers
    of Hispanic voters.

3. Unexpected findings – but low-priority for Dem donors (8)

    - Four districts look competitive in our model (TX-2, TX-3, TX-12, TX-22),
    at R+5 or a bit closer, but for all of them the historical model looks like safe R (R+10 or more).
    Although we think these may be far less GOP-leaning than historical results suggest,
    they all seem much harder to flip than TX-24 and TX-38.
    We’re keeping an eye on them, but recommend de-prioritizing them for now.

    - The historical model suggests that TX-23 is lean R (R+3),
    but our model sees it as R+15.  We would therefore classify it as “safe R”
    and de-prioritize it for donors.

4. Expected findings – safe D and safe R districts (25)

    - Several TX districts are clearly far outside the 3-point range and don’t merit
    serious investment by Dems looking to maximize their impact.

    - Both the demographic model and the historical model agree that there are 10 safe D
    districts (TX-7, TX-9, TX-16, TX-18, TX-20, TX-29, TX-30, TX-32, TX-33,
    TX-37), though our model sees them as slightly less safe
    than the historical model, particularly TX-35.

    - Both models also agree that there are 18 safe R districts (TX-1, TX-4, TX-5, TX-6, TX-8, TX-10,
    TX-11, TX-13, TX-14, TX-17, TX-19, TX-21, TX-23, TX-25, TX-26, TX-27, TX-31, TX-36),
    though our model sees some of them as somewhat more competitive than the historical model.

This might be clearer in a table, here sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
