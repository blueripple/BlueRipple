With its large share of non-White eligible voters and relatively high density,
the Blue Ripple model sees CA-9 as 57% Dem-leaning,
slightly above the history-based prediction of 55% D.
But even more promising, the district is demographically similar to AZ-07,
which is expected to run 67% Dem based on historical results,
suggesting a very strong D performance is within our grasp.
