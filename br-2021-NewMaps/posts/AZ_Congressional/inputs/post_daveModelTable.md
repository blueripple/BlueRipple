## 2. Districts worthy of Dem donor support
Based on the results above, we think there are two good options
for Dem donors in AZ: AZ-1, AZ-4 and two interesting long-shots: AZ-5
and AZ-8.
We think AZ-7 is safe although we’re going to keep an eye on any
polling there.

Our findings in AZ-5 and AZ-8 provide a good opportunity to discuss why BR’s demographic
model and the historical model may differ. Both AZ-5 and AZ-8 are safe R given the
voting patterns in the precincts within them,
but our demographic model suggests they are both tossups.
What might this mean? One way to answer this question is to consider the difference between the two models.
Our demographic model asks: if the voting-age citizens of this district turned out and voted like similar people
in other parts of the country,  what would we expect the outcome of this election to be?
Whereas the historical model asks how we'd expect the election to turn out if the voters in this district turn out and
vote as they have in previous elections. This points to a few possible reasons why historically
safe R districts might look like a toss-up in our model -- including, but not limited to, the following:

- Our model may be wrong about how we define "similar" voters. We've incorporated factors like education and race,
  but maybe we've missed key things that make voters in AZ-5 and AZ-8 different from superficially
  "similar" voters in other districts nationwide.

- Location-specific factors may suppress Dem voting. E.g., perhaps there is an unusual
  level of Dem voter suppression or lack of organization of the local Democratic party
  in AZ-5 and AZ-8 and that is reflected in the historical
  model using those voters.

- Democrats may, in fact, have underperformed relative to their potential. Or there may have
  been demographic shifts favoring Dems in the district since the last couple of elections.

We don't know which (if any) of these explanations is correct. But our model suggests that AZ-5
and AZ-8 might be more winnable than the historical analysis suggests.

## 3.	Coming next from Blue Ripple

Here’s where we’re planning to take these analyses over the next few months:

- We’re going to do the same type analysis in many (all?) of the states,
in order to identify the best options for Dem donors in 2022 on both
offense and defense nationwide.  Here are our takes on
[Michigan][MIPost],
[North Carolina][NCPost],
[Pennsylvania][PAPost]
and [Texas][TXPost].

- We’re going to continue to refine and improve our demographic model–we’ll
update this post and others as we do so. Feel free to contact us if you want
more details on the mechanics, or if you’d like to propose changes or improvements.
- As maps get solidified, we’ll set up ActBlue donation links for candidates
(after the primaries) to make it easy for you to donate.

We’re also on Twitter, Facebook, and Github.

## 4. Coda #1: Demographics of new vs. old AZ districts
One thing we haven’t seen discussed very much is how redistricting in AZ
has changed the demographics in each district. As a way of putting the
demographic model results in context, let’s look at the underlying
population two different ways:

- The first chart below shows each of AZ’s proposed 2022 districts,
with the population broken down by race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, Asian,
White-non-Hispanic and other) and education (college graduate and
non-college graduate).
Each bar also has a dot representing the (logarithmic) population density[^popDens]
of the district.
The scale for that dot is on the right-side axis of the chart.
For reference, a log density of 5 represents about 150 people per square mile and a
log density of 8 represents about 3000 people per square mile.
We’ve ordered the districts by D-share based on our demographic model,
which is helpful for understanding how the model responds to demographics and density.

- In the second chart, we look at these demographics a different way,
placing each AZ district according to its proportion of college graduates
and non-white citizens of voting age. We also indicate (logarithmic)
population density via the size of the circle and modeled D-edge (D-share minus 50%)
via color. This makes it easier to see that the model predicts larger D vote-share
as the district becomes more educated, more non-white and more dense.

[^popDens]: We use logarithms here because
density varies tremendously over districts, from tens to hundreds of thousands of people per square mile.
We use population-weighting because the resulting average more closely expresses
the density of where people actually live.  For example, consider a district made up of a high-density
city where 90% of the population live and then large but low-density exurbs where the other 10% live.
Most people in that district live at high density and we want our density to reflect that even though
the unweighted average density (people/district size) might be smaller.
