We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model and 47-53% in the historical model.
That’s because we think a 3-point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking. Our demographic model carries some
additional uncertainties, so we expand the range a bit there.  Our methodology for
using our model and the historical data to classify districts is explained
[in this post][BRMethodology].

With that in mind,  here are a few observations on the new AZ districts:

- First, let’s dispense with the obvious ones. Several AZ districts are clearly
  far outside the competitive range and don’t merit serious investment by Dems
  looking to maximize their impact. Both the demographic model and the historical
  model agree that AZ-3 is safe D.
  Both models also agree that AZ-2, AZ-6 and AZ-9 are safe R.

- Historically AZ-7 is safe D though we see it as a D-leaning toss-up. We suspect this
  is because our use of 2020 election data has shifted our expectation of voter preference
  among Hispanic voters somewhat more toward the republicans. In 2020 this was more a feature
  of elections in FL and TX, so hopefully AZ-7 is safe but we will be paying attention as
  polling shows up from this district.

- Historically AZ-5 and AZ-8 are safe R but we saee both as toss-ups. These might be interesting
  districts for donors with an eye toward building for the future or as “plausible long-shots.”
  More on them below.

- AZ-1 and AZ-4 are toss-ups in the demographic model and historically.

Here’s a different look at the data, in a table sorted by the Dem share in our demographic model.
