We generally focus our attention on districts that fall in the 45-55% range of Dem share
in our demographic model. That’s because we think a 3-4 point gap is one
that either party could potentially close with some focused energy,
resources, and strategic thinking and all models have some uncertainty which we acknowledge
by widening the range an extra point on both sides.

With those preliminaries in mind,
here are a few unexpected observations on the new PA lower-house districts:

1. Unexpected findings – pickup opportunities for Dem donors (2)

    - Our model shows strong D performance is possible in PA-40 and PA-178. PA-178 overlaps
    with the possibly competitive PA-1, making donations there even more useful.

2. Unexpected findings – potential defense opportunities for Dem donors (4)

   - There are also places where we are concerned that historically safe-looking districts might be in need of
   defense. In particular, PA-29 looks R+3 in our model but D+6 historically,
   PA-26 looks R+5 in our model but D+5 historically D+5,
   PA-33 looks R+5 in our model but D+4 historically,
   PA-82 looks R+8 in our model but D+5 historically. All but PA-82 overlap competitive congressional districts.
