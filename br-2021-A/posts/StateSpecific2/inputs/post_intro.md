# State-Specific Turnout Gaps: 2012 to 2020

In our [last research post][BR:StateSpecific1] we introduced a model for
using two census data-sets (the [CPS-VRS][USCB:CPS-VRS]
for state-level voter turnout and the [ACS][USCB:ACS] for population counts)
to estimate the gap between the turnout of voters-of-color (VOC) and
white-non-Hispanic voters (WHNV) in each state.  Our interest is in
understanding how state-specific differences,
e.g., local organizing and policies around voting, contribute to
turnout gaps so we looked at
the part of the gap remaining after we account
for the demographic differences among states: differences in the ages, education
levels of both groups and racial/ethnic makeup of the VOC.

That post focused exclusively on 2020.  Here we take a broader view,
examining all the elections, presidential and mid-term, since 2012,
and looking at the trends in a few states.

We begin by showing the state-specific turnout gap in all the states, charted
along with the model uncertainty.  The scale of the charts is a bit large since
some of the uncertainties are quite large.
