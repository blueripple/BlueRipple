If there is any correlation here, it's weak or negative.
And WA being an outlier in both dimensions---it's got the largest
negative state-specific VOC turnout and the *best* election-integrity
rating on voting---throws off any simple conclusions.
Is this because grass-roots organizing
sometimes overcomes voter suppression? If this is true, it's very hard to measure.
And, even if organizing blunts the effects of suppressive policies, those policies
are still immoral, not least because whatever time and energy is spent opposing
them could be spent in better and more productive ways.
