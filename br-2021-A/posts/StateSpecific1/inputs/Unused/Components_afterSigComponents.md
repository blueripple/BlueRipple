The split between the turnout shift from "VOC Demographics" vs. "State-Specific"
state itself is strongly influenced by what we include in the model
and how we include it.
Perhaps if we added other factors, e.g., religion or median-income, shifts that
appear to be state-specific would instead turn out to be explained by the other factors.
We have included the biggest factors that tend to correlate with voter turnout,
and we believe that some of the shifts we see are too large to be explained by other factors.
But itâ€™s important to be mindful of the limits of this sort of analysis.

Below we chart the component breakdowns for all 50 states.
