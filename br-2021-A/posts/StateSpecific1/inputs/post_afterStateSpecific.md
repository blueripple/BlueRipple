The 90% confidence intervals are large—in very few states is the state-specific
gap clearly non-zero.  Let's zoom in on those, retaining only
states where we are 90% (or more) confident that the state-specific component of VOC
turnout is not zero[^rankNote].  Here we’ll shrink the turnout scale (x-axis) a bit.

[^rankNote]: This is a somewhat naive way to look at these intervals.  Just because the intervals
include zero does not mean they don’t provide information that’s as useful as the others. One question
we might ask is how typical is the *spread* among these values? The spread among the expectations is
not the same as the expectation of the spread.  In this case, they are roughly consistent, with
the expected standard-deviation of the spread being 5.9% (and between 4.5% and 7.4% with 90% confidence) and
the expected range (maximum - minimum)
being 29% (between 21% and 38% with 90% confidence).
