Across the states, gaps vary by 32 points, from a high of +4%
in AL to -28% in WA.
Can this gap be explained by demographic differences alone?
The VOC in AL are mostly Black while the VOC in WA are mostly Hispanic.  Black
voters turned out at higher rates than Hispanic voters nationwide.  Perhaps
this explains the turnout gap between WA and PA? Using our model, we can
estimate the gaps that would result if there were no state-specific effects[^modelCompare].
We chart this (on the same scale) below.

[^modelCompare]: We post-stratify the full model but with and without the interaction term.
    We could instead model the two situations separately: the presence of the interaction term
    in the full model shifts the other parameters. But using two models, one for the
    demographic effects and a different one for state-specific effects, complicates
    the estimation of confidence intervals for various quantities.
