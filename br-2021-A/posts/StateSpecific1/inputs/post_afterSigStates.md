\(2) In particular, in 2020, CO, AL, PA, GA, and MI have clearly positive state-specific
turnout gaps and WA, IL, MA, NH, and FL have clearly negative state-specific
turnout gaps.

One hypothesis we have is that the state-specific gaps
reflect a push and pull between voter-suppression and organizing in each state.
That might be reflected somewhat in this list: there is strong and consistent organizing
in the swing-states, like PA and MI, and organizing in GA was obviously a big factor.
There's a history of Black-voter-organizing in AL which might explain the positive state-specific
effect. CO might have a smaller-than-expected gap because of universal mail-in voting, though
WA, NV and OR also have universal vote-by-mail.

On the negative side, it's less clear, though FL has a long and sordid history of voter
suppression. M

## The Big Questions
- What is or isn't happening in CO, AL, PA, GA and MI to improve turnout gaps?
Conversely, what is or isn't happening WA, IL, MA, NH and FL to make the gaps worse?
Understanding this might help narrow the gaps in many states.

- Why is the demographic component so large?  In this piece, we've been focusing on state-specific
effects, because we are interested in state-level solutions, especially organizing
around VOC turnout and against suppressive state-policies.  But looming over all of this is
the fact that VOC turnout (particularly Hispanic, Asian and Native-American turnout)
lags WNH and Black turnout nationwideâ€”by more than 9 points in 2020, by no means an atypical year.
That tips lots of elections to Republicans in places where Dems ought
to be competitive, especially state-legislative and house seats.

## What's Next?
At the height of the election cycle we focused nearly all of our pieces on actionable ideas.
But, in this off-cycle year, we are trying to understand the last election so
that we may apply some new wisdom as we go forward.  The organizing which helped carry
GA, PA, MI, NV, etc. were inspiring and, we hope, repeatable.

For us, that work begins by seeing what we can learn from the data.
We know that is only one way into the story, but for us it helps refine
our ideas, pointing in new directions and improving the questions we ask.
Some pieces, like this one, raise more questions than they answer.

Next we will look back, at the 2012 and 2016 presidential
elections, and also at the 2014 and 2018 midterms, and see if this same
analysis, and the trends they reveal, together help us understand 2020
and figure out how to apply those lessons moving forward.  Stay tuned!
