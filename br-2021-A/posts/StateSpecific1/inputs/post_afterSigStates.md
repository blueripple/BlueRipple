\(2) In particular, in 2020, CO, AL, PA, GA, and MI have clearly positive state-specific
VOC turnout and WA, IL, MA, NH, and FL have clearly negative state-specific
VOC turnout. One hypothesis we have is that the state-specific component of VOC
turnout reflects some balance between voter-suppression and organizing in each state.
And that might be reflected somewhat in this list: there is always organizing in the swing-states,
like PA and MI, and organizing in GA was obviously a big factor.
There's a history of Black-voter-organizing in AL. CO might be because of mail-in voting.
On the negative side, it's less clear.

## The Big Questions
- What is or isn't happening in CO, AL, PA, GA and MI to produce improved VOC turnout?
Conversely, what is or isn't happening WA, IL, MA, NH and FL to depress VOC turnout?
Understanding this might help improve VOC turnout in a number of states.

- Why is the demographic component so large?  In this piece, we've been focusing on state-specific
effects, because we are interested in state-level solutions, especially organizing
around VOC turnout and against suppressive state-policy.  But looming over all of this is
the fact that VOC turnout (particularly Hispanic, Asian and Native-American turnout)
lags WNH turnout nationwide---by more than 9 points in 2020, by no means an atypical year.
That tips lots of elections to Republicans in places where Dems ought
to be competitive, especially state-legislative and house seats.

## What's Next?
At the height of the election cycle we focused nearly all of our pieces on actionable ideas.
But, in this off-cycle year, we are trying to understand the last election so
that we may apply some new wisdom as we go forward.  The organizing which helped carry
GA, PA, MI, NV, etc. were inspiring and, we hope, repeatable.

For us, that work begins by seeing what we can learn from the data.
We know that is only one way into the story, but for us it helps refine
our ideas, pointing in new directions and improving the questions we ask.
Some pieces, like this one, raise more questions than they answer.

Next we will look back, at the 2012 and 2016 presidential
elections, and also at the 2014 and 2018 midterms, and see if this same
analysis, and the trends they reveal together help us understand 2020
and figure out how to apply those lessons moving forward.  Stay tuned!

We may also re-do this analysis with other sources, e.g., the CCES.
This might allow us to better estimate the errors introduced by the
lack of validation in the CPS-VRS.
