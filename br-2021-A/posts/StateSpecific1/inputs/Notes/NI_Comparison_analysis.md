The results are fairly close, most differences are between 0.5 and 1 point of
turnout. The turnout gaps in the full model are all slightly smaller in magnitude
(less negative) and have larger confidence intervals.  For all 50 states (and DC)
the confidence interval of the model without SRI result lies within the confidence
interval of the full model.
So we are comfortable using the "demographic" component as calculated via the full
model.
