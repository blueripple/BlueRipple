The results are fairly close, most differences are between 0.5 and 1 point of
turnout. The turnout gaps in the full model are all slightly smaller in magnitude
(less negative).  This is likely due to the fact that in the full model, there is
some ambiguity between what appears in the overall state-level turnout term and what
appears in the SRI term.  The SRI term is binaryâ€“we estimate a single number which
is positive for VOC and negative for WHNV.  If the number of VOC and WHNV are different,
then the SRI term and the overall state-level turnout term are somewhat overlapping
in setting the overall turnout level.
As an extreme example, imagine a state where all the voters are VOC.  In this case,
the overall state-level turnout term and the SRI term are entirely redundant.
In many states the VOC population is smaller, sometimes much smaller, than the WHNV
population and this leads to the difference we see in the models.
