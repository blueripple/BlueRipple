## Ranking the State-Specific Turnout Gaps

Looking at the chart of state-specific VOC/WNHV turnout gaps (figure 3),
one might wonder if itâ€™s possible that the state-specific effects are quite
small. If the positive gaps are actually at the small end of the confidence
interval and the negative ones are all at the large end, while the rest are
all close to 0, we might only have a range (excluding the outlier of WA) of
-3 to 2.  It seems worth digging into that a bit.  Firstly we can also compute
the standard-deviation (width) of the gaps and a confidence interval around that.
