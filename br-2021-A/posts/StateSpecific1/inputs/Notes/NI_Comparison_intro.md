We want to focus on the *state-specific* turnout gap:
what remains of the gap after we account for the part which comes from
turnout among different types of voters and the demographic makeup of the state.
To do this we compute four post-stratifications--VOC and WHNV turnout with and without interaction--
and take the appropraite differences.  When we do all this in the same model fit we can also
compute a confidence interval of that difference.  If we compute the with interaction and without
interaction models separately, we can still compute the differences, but we lose the ability
to estimate a confidence interval for the difference.
But we should check tha the non-interaction turnout computed with the full model is similar
to what we would find if we estimated without the interaction term.  We chart this below.
Results from the full model are in blue and the non-interaction model in orange.
