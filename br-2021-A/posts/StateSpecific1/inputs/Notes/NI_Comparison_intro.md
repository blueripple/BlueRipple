We want to focus on the *state-specific* turnout gap, i.e.,
what remains of the gap after we account for the "demographic" part, coming from
national-level turnout among different types of voters
combined with the demographic makeup of the state.
To do this we compute four post-stratifications–
VOC and WHNV turnout with and without state/race interaction (SRI)–
then take the appropriate differences.  If we do this in the same Monte-Carlo
model fit we can also
estimate a confidence interval for that difference.
When we estimate the with-SRI and without-SRI
models separately, we lose the ability
to estimate a confidence intervals for the difference.

But adding the SRI term shifts the other parameters some,
so we should check that estimating the "demographic" turnout
with the full model is similar
to estimating without the SRI term. The estimates and confidence intervals for
both models are shown below.
Results from the full model are in blue and the no-SRI model in orange.
