\(2) In particular, in 2020, CO, AL, PA, GA, and MI have clearly positive state-specific
VOC turnout and WA, IL, MA, NH, and FL have clearly negative state-specific
VOC turnout. One hypothesis we have is that the state-specific component of VOC
turnout reflects some balance between voter-suppression and organizing in each state.
And that might be reflected somewhat in this list: there is always organizing in the swing-states,
like PA and MI, and organizing in GA was obviously a big factor.
There's a history of Black-voter-organizing in AL. CO might be because of mail-in voting.
On the negative side, it's less clear.

\(3) Does this map to some measure of election integrity? Below we make
a scatter plot of the state-specific component of VOC turnout and
an ["Election Integrity"](https://www.electoralintegrityproject.com)
score for voting each state, computed by surveying experts and averaging their
    responses across a variety of voting-related topics.
