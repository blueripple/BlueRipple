# Turnout Gaps

In the chart below, we look at the 2020 state turnout gaps
(along with 90% percent confidence intervals) estimated
by our model, without the state-race interaction.
These gaps come from the *national* turnout gap between VOC and WNH voters and the
differences among states come entirely from different distributions of ages,
gender, education and population density among the VOC and WNH
populations in that state.  These gaps
average about -11 pts—indicating 11% more WNH voters turned out than VOC nationally—
ranging from -6 points in NV to -20 points in SD.
The average gap can be quite different year-to-year and it was, for example, close to 0 in 2012.
In each of the following charts, the zero-line is marked in blue and the mean of the
turnout gaps in orange.
