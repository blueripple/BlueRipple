The split between the turnout shift from "VOC Demographics" vs. "State-Specific"
state itself is strongly influenced by what we include in the model
and how we include it.
Perhaps if we added other factors, e.g., religion or median-income, shifts that
appear to be state-specific would instead turn out to be explained by the other factors.
We have included the biggest factors that tend to correlate with voter turnout,
and we believe that some of the shifts we see are too large to be explained by other factors.
But itâ€™s important to be mindful of the limits of this sort of analysis.

## The Big Questions
- What is or isn't happening in PA, SC and NV to produce improved VOC turnout?
Conversely, what is or isn't happening in AZ, IA, FL and MA to depress VOC turnout?
Understanding that ought to help improve VOC turnout in a number of states.

- Why is the demographic component so large?  In this piece, we've been focusing on state-specific
effects, because we are interested in state-level solutions, especially organizing
around VOC turnout and against suppressive state-policy.  But looming over all of this is
the fact that VOC turnout, especially Hispanic and Asian turnout, lag WNH turnout
nationwide.  That tips lots of elections to Republicans in places where Dems ought
to be competitive, especially state-legislative and house seats.

- Was this all similar in 2020?  We're waiting on the CPS-VRS microdata
