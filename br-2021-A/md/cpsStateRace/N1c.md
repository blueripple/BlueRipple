Finally, we look at the state-specific portion of the gap.  Note that this comes from NWNH
voters and WNH voters.  A positive turnout gap might come from NWNH voters turning out at higher
rates than we expect from national averages and demographics or it might come from WNH voters
turning out at lower rates. This ambigiuity is why we focus just on NWNH turnout rates in the
main piece.
