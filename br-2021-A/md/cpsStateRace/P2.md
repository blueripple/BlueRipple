The 90% confidence intervals are largeâ€”in very few states is the state-specific
effect on VOC voters clearly non-zero.

(2) How much of the difference between VOC and average turnout is state-specific?
We focus on the states with clearly non-zero (90% confidence)
state-specific VOC turnout effects and look at the demographic
*and* state-specific components on one chart. In the chart below,
the difference between VOC and average turnout in a state (red) is
broken into two components: the state-specific portion (blue)
and the "demographic" component (orange) which comes from the nationwide turnout
rates of the demographic mix of VOC in that particular state.
