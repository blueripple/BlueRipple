The 90% confidence intervals are largeâ€”in very few states is the state-specific
effect on VOC voters clearly non-zero.

Now we focus on the states with clearly non-zero (90% confidence)
state-specific VOC turnout effects and then chart the demographic
and state-specific components on one chart.  In the bar chart below,
we chart the difference between VOC and average turnout in a state and
break it into two components: the state-specific poriton charted above
and the "demographic" component which comes from the nationwide turnout
rates of the demographic mix of VOC in that particular state.
