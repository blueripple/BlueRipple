\(2) In particular, in 2020, DE, AL, PA, MI, NJ, and CA have clearly positive state-specific
VOC turnout and WA, IL, KS, NH, MA, and KY have clearly negative state-specific
VOC turnout. One hypothesis we have is that the state-specific component of VOC
turnout reflects some balance between voter-suppression and organizing in each state.
And that might be reflected somewhat in this list: there is always organizing in the swing-states,
like PA and MI and a history of Black-voter-organizing in AL. But that leaves DE. NJ and CA
something of a mystery on the positive side. On the negative side, KS and KY are perhaps
unsurprising.  But WA, IL, NH and MA? SOMETHING HERE

\(3) Does this map to some measure of election integrity? Below we make
a scatter plot of the state-specific component of VOC turnout and
an ["Election Integrity"](https://www.electoralintegrityproject.com)
score for voting each state, computed by surveying experts and averaging their
    responses across a variety of voting-related topics.
