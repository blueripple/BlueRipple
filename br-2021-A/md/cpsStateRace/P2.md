\(2) In particular, in 2016, PA, SC, NV, MD, LA, and MI have clearly positive state-specific
VOC turnout and AZ, IA, FL, MA, WA, CA, and NY have clearly negative state-specific
VOC turnout. One hypothesis we have is that the state-specific component of VOC
turnout reflects some balance between voter-suppression and organizing in each state.
And that might be reflected somewhat in this list: SC has a long history of voter organizing,
and there is always organizing in the swing-states, like PA, NV, and MI. But that leaves LA
something of a mystery on the positive side. On the negative side, AZ, IA, FL are perhaps
unsurprising.  But WA, MA, CA and NY?  Do a little digging, and you discover that MA and NY
were notoriously bad at provoding convenient ways for people to vote,
though this has begun to change. WA and CA are a little harder to explain.

\(3) Does this map to some measure of election integrity? Below we make
a scatter plot of the state-specific component of VOC turnout and
an ["Election Integrity"](https://www.electoralintegrityproject.com)
score for voting each state, computed by surveying experts and averaging their
    responses across a variety of voting-related topics.
