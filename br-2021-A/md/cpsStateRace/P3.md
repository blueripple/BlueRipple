If there is any correlation here, it's weak. Is this because grass-roots organizing
sometimes overcomes voter suppression? If this is true, it's very hard to measure.
And, even if organizing blunts the effects of suppressive policies, those policies
are still immoral, not least because whatever time and energy is spent opposing
them could be spent in better and more productive ways.

\(4) How much of the difference between VOC and WNH is state-specific?
We continue to focus on the states with clearly non-zero (90% confidence)
state-specific VOC turnout effects and look at the demographic
*and* state-specific components on one chart. Below,
the difference between VOC and average turnout in a state (red) is
broken into two components: the state-specific portion (blue)
and the "demographic" component (orange) which comes from the nationwide turnout
rates of the demographic mix of VOC in that particular state.
