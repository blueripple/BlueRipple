Looking at this, it's difficult to see how the state-specific component of the VOC
turnout is any measure of election-integrity alone. This is likely because poor election
integrity is often overcome by organizing and/or local interest in a specific election.

\(4) How much of the difference between VOC and average turnout is state-specific?
We continue to focus on the states with clearly non-zero (90% confidence)
state-specific VOC turnout effects and look at the demographic
*and* state-specific components on one chart. In the chart below,
the difference between VOC and average turnout in a state (red) is
broken into two components: the state-specific portion (blue)
and the "demographic" component (orange) which comes from the nationwide turnout
rates of the demographic mix of VOC in that particular state.
