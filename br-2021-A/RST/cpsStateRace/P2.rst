Three initial questions (and answers) about voter turnout and race
===================================================================

Now we’re positioned to be able to post three questions about each state’s NWNH turnout:

1. How much worse (or better) was each state’s NWNH turnout in 2016 compared with what one would have expected?
2. How did each state’s NWNH turnout change from 2012 to 2016?
3. xxxxxxxx


(1) Observed vs. expected NWNH turnout in 2016 by state:
Below we look *only* at the “State NWNH Turnout Effect”, taking
the difference of the estimated NWNH turnout in a state and subtracting
the estimated NWNH turnout *based on the demographics alone*.
PA is at the top with 4 point better-than-expected
turnout of NWNH voters and AZ is at the bottom, with 5 point
worse-than-expected turnout of NWNH voters.
