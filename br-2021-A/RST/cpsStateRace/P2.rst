So below we look *only* at the “State NWNH Turnout Effect”, taking
the difference of the estimated NWNH turnout in a state and subtracting
the estimated NWNH turnout *based on the demographics alone*.
PA is at the top with 4 point better-than-expected
turnout of NWNH voters and AZ is at the bottom, with 5 point
worse-than-exoected turnout of NWNH voters.
