Though we can see some things clearly in these charts, there are large confidence intervals and a lot of states!
So we zoom in two different ways.  First we’ll look at all the gaps which are significant (we are 90% confident that
the gap is not 0) in *both* 2012 and 2016 and then we’ll look at gaps which have changed significantly between 2012
and 2016, that is those for which the  2016 confidence interval is outside the 2012 confidence interval.
