Examining in a little more detail, we’ll first look at all the gaps which are significant (90% confidence that
the gap is not 0) and persistent (same direction) in *both* 2012 and 2016. Then we’ll look at gaps which have
changed significantly between 2012
and 2016, that is those for which the 2016 confidence interval is outside the 2012 confidence interval.
