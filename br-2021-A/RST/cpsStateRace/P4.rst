We can compare 2012 to 2016 a few ways.  We start by plotting the estimated effect for 2016 vs 2012,
excluding any state for which the 2012 and 2016 confidence intervals both include 0. States in the
upper right all had NWNH turnout exceeding expectations in both years and the lower left is populated
by states with NWNH turnout below expectations in both years.
