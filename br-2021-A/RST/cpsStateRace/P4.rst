At the top, in PA and SC, there was an 8 pt state-specific boost in relative
NWNH voting rates.
By contrast, AZ is at the bottom, with a 9 point state-specific deficit in relative
NWNH voting rates.
The 90% confidence intervals are large—very few state-specific turnout gaps
are clearly non-zero.

We should emphasize
that the split between what we attribute to demographics of the state vs. the
state itself is strongly influenced by what we include in the model
and how we include it.
Perhaps if we added other factors, e.g., religion or median-income, gaps that
appear to be state-specific would instead be explained by these other factors.
We’ve included the biggest factors that tend to correlate with voter turnout
and we believe that the gaps we see are too large to be explained by other factors.
But it’s important to be mindful of the limits of this sort of analysis.

We’ve done the same analysis for 2012, and we chart
