At the top, in SC, there was an 11 pt state-specific boost in NWNH voting rates.
By contrast, WA is at the bottom, with a 10 point state-specific deficit in NWNH
voting rates.  Part of this difference is explained by the different composition
of the NWNH population of the various states.  Black people make up most of the
NWNH population of SC, whereas Hispanic people make up most of the NWNH people in
WA (and AZ).  Historically, eligible Black voters vote at much higher rates than
eligible Hispanic voters.
