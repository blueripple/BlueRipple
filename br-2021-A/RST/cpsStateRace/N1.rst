In the chart below, we look at the 2016 state turnout gaps
(along with 90% percent confidence intervals) predicted
by our model, without the state-race interaction.
These gaps come from the *national* turnout gap between NWNH and WNH voters and the
differences among states come entirely from different distributions of ages,
gender and education among the NWNH and WNH populations in that state.  These gaps
average about -10 pts—indicating 9% more WNH voters turned out than NWNH nationally—
ranging from -4 points in MI to -25 points in SD.
The average gap can be quite different year-to-year and it was, for example, close to 0 in 2012.
In each of the following charts, the zero-line is marked in blue and the mean of the
turnout gaps in orange.
