So below we look *only* at the state-race interaction term, isolating
the portion of the turnout gap attributable to the state. These average
to 0â€“as they should since they reflect the state-specific difference from
the average gap. In this case PA is at the top with 8 point better-than-average
relative turnout of NWNH voters and AZ is at the bottom, with 9 point
worse-than-average relative turnout of NWNH voters.  We add color to give
some indication of the source of the gap.
